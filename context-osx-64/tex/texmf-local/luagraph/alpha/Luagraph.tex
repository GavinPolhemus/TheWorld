% comment   : Because this manual is distributed with TeX distributions it comes with a rather
%             liberal license. We try to adapt these documents to upgrades in the (sub)systems
%             that they describe. Using parts of the content otherwise can therefore conflict
%             with existing functionality and we cannot be held responsible for that. Many of
%             the manuals contain characteristic graphics and personal notes or examples that
%             make no sense when used out-of-context.

% comment   : A proof-of-concept for the present luagraph module was presented at the ConTeXt
%             2018 user meeting. The completely re-written graph code is to be part of 
%             the MetaFun code modules.
