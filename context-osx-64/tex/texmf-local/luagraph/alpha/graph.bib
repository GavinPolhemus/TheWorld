	discussion)},
  journal = {Journal of Computational and Statistical Graphics},
  volume = {2},

  number = {4},
  abstract = {A method of statistical graphics consists of two parts: a selection
	of statistical information to be displayed and a selection of a visual
	display method to encode the information. Some display methods lead
	to efficient, accurate visual decoding of encoded information, and
	others lead to inefficient, inaccurate decoding. It is only through
	rigorous studies of visual decoding that informed judgments can be
	made about how to choose display methods. A model has been developed
	to provide a framework for the study of visual decoding. The model
	consists of three parts: (1) a two-way classification of information
	on displays—quantitative-scale, quantitative-physical, categorical-scale,
	and categorical-physical; (2) a division of the visual processing
	of graphical displays into pattern perception and table look-up;
	(3) a specification of visual operations that are employed to carry
	out pattern perception and table look-up. Display methods are assessed
	by studying the visual operations to which they lead. Studies use
	the theory and experimental technique of various areas of vision
	research including psychophysics, cognitive psychology, and computational
	vision. This process is illustrated by studies of three display methods:
	visual reference grids for graphs with juxtaposed panels and common
	scales, encoding a categorical variable on a scatterplot by the type
	of plotting symbol, and choosing the aspect ratio of a factor-response
	graph.},
