The theoretical development of the laws of motion of bodies is a problem of such interest and importance, that it has engaged the attention of all the most eminent mathematicians, since the invention of dynamics as a mathematical science by \scaps{Galileo}, and especially since the wonderful extension which was given to that science by \scaps{Newton}. Among the successors of those illustrious men, \scaps{Lagrange} has perhaps done more than any other analyst, to give extent and harmony to such deductive researches, by showing that the most varied consequences respecting the motions of systems of bodies may be derived from one radical formula; the beauty of the method so suiting the dignity of the results, as to make of his great work a kind of scientific poem\dots.
%But the science of force, or of power acting by law in space and time, has undergone already another revolution, and has become already more dynamic, by having almost dismissed the conceptions of solidity and cohesion, and those other material ties, or geometrically imaginably conditions, which \scaps{Lagrange} so happily reasoned on, and by tending more and more to resolve all connexions and actions of bodies into attractions and repulsions of points: and while the science is advancing thus in one direction by the improvement of physical views, it may advance in another direction also by the invention of mathematical methods.
And the method proposed in the present essay, for the deductive study of the motions of attracting or repelling systems, will perhaps be received with indulgence, as an attempt to assist in carrying forward so high an inquiry.%\autocite[p.48]{Galileo1610}

%\section[sec:GravUSolarSys]{Gravitational potential energy in the Solar System}

\Initial{I}{n the year that \booktitle{Hydrodynamica} was published,} 1738, Daniel Bernoulli wrote a paper on the motion of the Moon. Gravitational forces in the solar system had already been studied in some detail using Newton’s methods of momentum and force.
The Moon's motion is difficult to study using Newton's methods,  because it is pulled by both Earth and the Sun. Daniel Bernoulli attacked the problem using potential and kinetic energy, and made significant progress. %In this section, we will solve some easier problems using D.~Bernoulli's method.

\section[sec:GravUSolarSys]{Gravitational potential energy in the Solar System}

The gravitational potential energy formula in \in{Chapter}[ch:PotentialEnergy], $U=mgh$, is only useful for relatively small heights near the Earth’s surface. Over the long distances between planets, moons, and the Sun, the gravitational potential energy is a bit more complicated. The gravitational potential energy of any two objects is
\startformula
	U = -G\frac{mM}{r},
\stopformula
where $m$ and $M$ are the objects’ masses, $r$ is the distance between the objects’ centers, and $G=6.67\sci{-11}\units{m^3/kg\.s^2}$ is the universal gravitational constant.

This formula is a bit intimidating, but extremely valuable if used correctly. Notice four things about this formula. First, the distance between the objects is in the denominator. If the distance is extremely large, then the gravitational potential energy is extremely small. This is quite convenient because it means that very distant objects can be ignored. When studying the interaction of the Earth and Moon, it is not necessary to include the gravitational potential energy due to distant stars.

Second, the distance is between the objects’ centers. When calculating the gravitational potential energy of an object on the Earth’s surface the distance $r$ is Earth’s radius ($r\sEarth=6.37\sci{6}\units{m}$) not the height above Earth’s surface.

Third, the formula always gives a negative potential energy. This has alarmed many people, including great physicists, but it is not a problem. The gravitational potential energy is zero when the objects are far apart and it goes down as objects get closer together. Down from zero is negative. Kinetic energy is always positive, but there is no reason to be alarmed by negative potential energy.

Finally, the universal gravitational constant $G$ is extremely small, so the gravitational potential energy between everyday objects can be completely ignored. At least one object must have a huge mass in order for the gravitational potential energy to be significant. Earth’s mass of $5.97\sci{24}\units{kg}$ is enough to have a significant effect.

\startexample[ex:BoxEarthGravU] How much work is required to lift a $3.0\units{kg}$ box from Earth’s surface to a location very far from Earth?

\startsolution
	This problem is just like the earlier example where Galileo lifted the pendulum (\in{ex.}[ex:GalileoPendulum1]), but now we must use the gravitational potential energy formula that works for large distances. The gravitational potential energy for the box and Earth are plotted in figure~\ref{fig:BoxEarthGravU}.

	\NC	H\si + W + \cancel{Q}	\NC = H\sf			\NR
	\NC	K\si + U\si + W			\NC = K\sf + U\sf
	\stopmathalignment\stopformula
	Since the box starts motionless on Earth and ends motionless far away, the initial and final kinetic energies are both zero. The final gravitational potential energy is also zero, because the box is very far from Earth. Only the work and initial potential energy remain. The initial distance between the box’s center and Earth’s center is Earth’s radius.

The energy graph in \in{figure}[fig:BoxEarthGravU] shows the box's tremendous increase in gravitational potential energy as it is moved far from Earth. It starts at Earth's surface, with a potential energy $U=-1.88\sci{8}\units{J}$. To move the box far away requires going off the graph, far to the right in \in{figure}[fig:BoxEarthGravU], to the where $U\approx 0\units{J}$. Objects sent to deep space require giant rockets which do the work required to reach the much higher gravitational potential energy.

Use D.~Bernoulli's new formula for gravitational potential energy whenever the problem involves objects far from Earth's surface. The new formula is more complicated looking that the old $U=mgh$, but use the new formula in exactly the same way when using conservation of energy.

\section{Gravitational potential}
We are going to step out of the historical story for a moment to address one of the most vexing questions about gravity: How does gravity reach across great distances?
Specifically, how does Earth pull objects downward, and how does the Sun hold planets in orbit?

%When you wish to move a box, you make physical contact with it. You might make contact directly by grabbing or kicking the box. You might make contact indirectly by pushing the box with a stick, pulling it with a string, or throwing a foot ball at it. You touch the box, or you touch something that touches the box, or you touch something that touches something else that touches the box. One way or another there must be some physical contact from you to the box. (You could move the box with magnets, but magnets are even more mysterious than gravity.)

Gravity's ability to move things has confounded all of the philosophers and physicists in our story so far. They certainly made plenty of guesses. Aristotle and the Aristotelians thought objects fall to find their correct place in the world. From the time of Aristotle to Copernicus, many thought the planets were held in orbit by crystal spheres. Kepler and Descartes thought the planets were swept along by an invisible fluid filling the solar system and swirling around the Sun.
%(Kepler also gave each planet a magnet and an oar\dash a fun but crazy theory that we will skip.) 
Supernatural explanations were offered as well.
These guesses were all reasonable and informed, based on the information available at the time, but none were verified with experiments or observations. 

A reasonable and informed guess that has not been verified by experiments and observations is a \keyterm{hypothesis}. As just described, there were many hypotheses offered to explain gravity. What was lacking was a \keyterm{theory} of gravity\dash an explanation that had been verified by experiments or observations.

Newton took a a huge step toward understanding gravity in his \booktitle{Principia}, where he offered a formula for the strength of the gravitational force between any two objects. This formula (which we will encounter soon) is now called Newton's law of universal gravitation. When a formula's accuracy has been verified by experiments or observations, it is called a \keyterm{law}, like Newton's laws of motion and the conservation laws for momentum and energy.
In the \booktitle{Principia}, Newton demonstrates that his law of universal gravitation explains all observed motions of the planets.

Newton also shows that fluid models like Descartes' do not match the observed motions, but Newton offers no alternative mechanism. Instead, he offers this:
\startblockquote
I have not as yet been able to discover the reason for these properties of gravity,\dots and I do not feign hypotheses\dots.
%For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction.
%The impenetrability, mobility and momentum of bodies, and the laws of motion and the law of gravity have been found by this method.\autocite{p.~943. \quotation{Impetus} changed to \quotation{momentum}}{Newton1999}
%And
It is enough that gravity really exists and acts according to the laws that we have set forth and is sufficient to explain all the motions of the heavenly bodies\dots.\autocite{p.~943.}{Newton1999}
\stopblockquote

Newton and his contemporaries certainly wanted to know how gravity reaches across the vast distances of the solar system, but they could predict the solar system's motions without knowing. Newton's law of universal gravitation was sufficient.

Today, we do know how gravity works, thanks to Einstein.
Einstein's theory of gravity is complicated, but it has been thoroughly tested and accepted as one of the great theories of modern physics.
Luckily, we can understand gravity's tremendous reach without mastering Einstein's full theory. All we  need is one part of the theory\dash a simple function called the \keyterm{gravitational potential}, $\Phi$. (This is a capital greek phi.)

The gravitational potential exists everywhere. At every location it has a specific value (possibly zero).
If space were completely empty, then the gravitational potential would be zero everywhere ($\Phi=0$).
Any massive object produces a region of negative gravitational potential in its vicinity. The gravitational potential produced by Earth is shown in \in{figure}[fig:EarthGravPotential], where $r$ is the distance from Earth's center.
The gravitational potential is most negative close to Earth, and rises toward zero far away.

The distance $r$ can be in any direction. \in{Figure}[fig:Phi3D] shows several directions away from Earth, with the gravitational potential plotted below.
Only horizontal directions are shown for $r$, so the vertical direction can be used to show the value of $\Phi$. In every direction, the gravitational potential is most negative close to Earth, and rises toward zero far away.

\marginTikZ{}{Phi3D}{Earth's region of negative gravitational potential extends in all directions. } % vskip, name, caption

The shape of $\Phi$ in \in{figure}[fig:Phi3D] looks similar to a trampoline that has been pressed down in the center, stretching the trampoline downward to create a wide depression that extends to the trampoline's edge.
The gravitational potential stretches much like a trampoline. Massive objects, like Earth, lower the potential, stretching the gravitational potential toward negative values and creating a wide depression that extends to great distances, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:Phi3D]. The deep negative potential near Earth is often called Earth's \keyterm{potential well}.

Object's far from Earth are affected by the altered gravitational potential. The depression in the gravitational potential causes other objects to fall toward Earth, just as a marble placed on the stretched trampoline will roll into the trampoline's depression. The Sun creates a much deeper and wider depression in the gravitational potential, sufficient to keep distant planets in orbit. 
The stretchy gravitational potential is how gravity reaches across vast distances.

The gravitational potential's trampoline-like stretchiness can be used to calculate the exact shape of the depression in \in{figures}[fig:EarthGravPotential] and \in[fig:Phi3D]. The calculation requires some calculus, but the simple answer is all we need.
At distance $r$ from the center of a mass $M$, the gravitational potential is 
\startformula
	\Phi = -\frac{GM}{r}.
\stopformula
This formula is responsible for D.~Bernoulli's gravitational potential energy formula and for Newton's law of universal gravitation.
(Einstein's full theory of gravity, General Relativity, gives a slightly different formula, but the formula above is an excellent approximation everywhere in our solar system.)

When the gravitational potential was first introduced, one-hundred fifty years before Einstein, nobody realized its deep significance or even recognized it as something real. But the gravitational potential is certainly real, it represents something deep about our universe, and it explains gravity's tremendous reach. Keep this in mind as we return to the historical story.

The gravitational potential was first introduced by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1773. Like D.~Bernoulli, Lagrange was attempting to explain details of the Moon's motion. Lagrange noticed that when a small object is pulled by the gravity of much larger objects, the small object's motion is unaffected by its own mass.
We saw this in \in{example}[ex:BoxEarthGravU2], where we calculated the final speed of a $\unit{3kg}$ box dropped from a great distance. Rather early in the calculation, the box's mass $m$ cancels out.
If the box had been $\unit{3g}$ or $\unit{3000kg}$, it would have hit the atmosphere with exactly the same speed.
Many earlier physicists, going back to Galileo, had noticed that the small object's mass does not matter, but Lagrange used this observation in a new way.

For Lagrange's complex calculations, he wanted the small object's mass drop out of the formulas earlier, before the formulas became too complicated.
To achieve this, he defined the small object's gravitational potential energy $U$ in terms of the gravitational potential $\Phi$.
\startformula
  U = m\Phi
\stopformula
To see the benefits of Lagrange's trick, let us consider a example using conservation of energy. The formulas threaten to become quite cumbersome, but the gravitational potential allows us to split the calculation into manageable parts.

When the comet is $\unit{1.50e12m}$ from the Sun (about as far as Saturn) its speed is $\unit{1.13e4 m/s} = \unit{11.3 km/s}$. What is the comet's speed when it makes its closest approach to the Sun at $\unit{8.77e10m}$?

Lagrange's Moon problem was much more complex than our Halley's Comet example above, and gravitational potential was a tremendous help in simplifying his formulas. In our effort to understand the new astronomy, gravitational potential energy will be a powerful tool.

%In Hydrodynamica and his other works, Daniel Bernoulli applied sharp physical insights to practical problems – pipes, fountains, pumps, and other useful machines. Everyone else was going in other directions.
%
%Engineers developed and applied methods specific to specialized applications without looking for broadly applicable physical principles. This practical approach was incredibly successful. Eighteenth century engineers launched the industrial revolution, building powerful working engines decades before physicists could explain them.

\section{Analytical Mechanics}

During the eighteenth century, physicists attacked many abstract problems in pure mechanics – planetary motion, spinning tops, and jointed pendulums. These problems had little practical value, but they inspired rapid advances in applied mathematics.
Leonhard Euler (a close friend of Danial Bernoulli), adapted and expanded Newton's methods to solve many new types of problems. Other physicists introduced new principles – like energy conservation – to solve problems in entirely new ways. These advances produced a rather confusing patchwork of methods and principles.

While Lagrange won awards for his papers on celestial mechanics, he also pursued a much more ambitious goal.
He sought to replace the patchwork of methods and principles with a single procedure that could be applied to any problem in mechanics. He delivered his revolutionary synthesis in \booktitle{Mécanique Analytique}, published in 1788, a century after Newton's \booktitle{Principia}. Lagrange describes his intent in the monumental work's preface.

\startblockquote
There already exist several treatises on mechanics, but the purpose of this one is entirely new. I propose to condense the theory of this science and the method of solving the related problems to general formulas whose simple application produces all the necessary equations for the solution of each problem. %I hope that my presentation achieves this purpose and leaves nothing lacking.
%In addition, this work will have another use. The various principles presently available will be assembled and presented from a single point of view in order to facilitate the solution of the problems of mechanics.
\stopblockquote

Lagrange's single procedure could be used to find equations of motion for any mechanical system, from Galileo's falling rock and interrupted pendulum to Kepler's planetary orbits and Mersenne's mysterious musical string. 

\booktitle{Mécanique Analytique} begins with a through and insightful historical review. Lagrange clearly enjoyed finding gems of truth in many different methods, and he also found inspiration.
He refashioned one ancient idea into a general procedure for relating Newton's momentum methods to D.~Bernoulli's energy methods. While this idea had ancient origins, Lagrange's mastery of calculus allowed him apply this idea in new and powerful ways.

\section{Lagrange finds force from potential energy}

Lagrange's insight was that Newton's force can be found from the energy graph of D.~Bernoulli's  potential energy.
\emph{The force's direction is toward lower potential energy.
  The force's magnitude is equal to the potential energy's slope on the energy graph.}
%If potential energy's slope is gentle, the force is small. If the potential energy's slope is steep, the force is large.

To understand Lagrange's insight, consider the cart connected to a spring in \in{figure}[fig:HookesLaw].
%%The cart's position is represented by $x$.
The graph in \in{figure}[fig:HookesLaw] shows the spring's potential energy, $U = \onehalf kx^2$, where $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium.
Each diagram in \in{figure}[fig:HookesLaw] shows the cart at a different position. These positions are also marked with dots on the energy graph.
Lagrange's insight allows us to find the spring's force\dash direction and magnitude\dash from the potential energy graph.

Lagrange tells us that the force's direction is toward lower potential energy.
Using the energy graph in \in{figure}[fig:HookesLaw], we see that lower potential energy is toward the center. When the cart is left of center, lower potential energy is to the right, producing the rightward force shown in the top two diagrams. When the cart is right of center, lower potential energy is to the left, producing the leftward force shown in the bottom two diagrams. When the cart is at the center, neither direction is toward lower potential energy, so no force is shown in the middle diagram.

Lagrange tells us that the force's magnitude is the potential energy graph's slope. Using the energy graph in \in{figure}[fig:HookesLaw], we see that far from the center, the slope is greatest, producing the large forces shown in the top and bottom diagrams. When the cart is closer to the center, the slope is smaller, producing the smaller forces shown in the second and fourth diagrams. When the cart is at the center, the slope is zero, producing no force in the middle diagram.

Finding the exact slope on the energy graph is not easy, but there is a simple formula for the slope called \keyterm{Hooke's law}.
\startformula
  F = - kx
\stopformula
The $k$ in Hooke's law is the same spring stiffness that appears in the spring's potential energy formula above.

We should compare Hooke's law to Lagrange's insight to see that they agree.
First, check the directions.
The negative sign in Hooke's law guarantees that the force opposes the displacement. When the cart's displacement $x$ is negative, the force $F$ is positive, pushing the cart in the positive direction, back toward the equilibrium point. When the cart's displacement is positive, the force pushes in the negative direction, also back toward the equilibrium point. Hooke's directions agree with Lagrange.
Second, check the magnitudes.
As the magnitude of $x$ increases, the magnitude of Hooke's force $F$ also increases, again in agreement with Lagrange.
Finally, when the cart is in the center, at $x=0$, Hooke's law gives $F=0$, in agreement with Lagrange. 
Lagrange's insight explains the spring's force. Hooke's law calculates the spring's force.


%On the right half of the graph, the slope is positive, so any motion in the positive direction leads to higher potential energy.
%The force, which is minus the slope, is therefore negative, pushing toward lower potential energy.
%On the left half of the graph, the slope is negative. Any motion in the positive direction leads toward lower potential energy, so the force, which is minus the slope, pushes in the positive direction, again toward lower potential energy.
%At the center, the slope and the force are both zero. Neither direction leads toward lower potential energy, and the force does not point in either direction.

Lagrange's insight also allows us to find the long range gravitational force from the long range gravitational potential energy (\at{p.}[sec:GravUSolarSys]).

Look at the energy graph to determine the force's direction and relative magnitude.
Lower potential energy is leftward, toward Earth, producing the leftward force shown on each box in the diagram.
%The gravitational potential energy's slope is positive everywhere, so the gravitational force is negative everywhere – pulling the box back in the negative direction, back toward Earth. 
This is similar to the right side of \in{figure}[fig:HookesLaw], where the spring potential energy's positive slope produces a negative spring force – pulling the block back toward the center. The spring's potential energy gets steeper as the spring is stretched, producing a spring force that increases with distance. The gravitational potential energy does the opposite, getting less steep as the box is moved farther from Earth, producing a gravitational force that decreases with distance. The diagram shows the largest force on the box closest to Earth and the smallest force on the box farthest away.

The formula for this gravitational force is \keyterm{Newton's law of universal gravitation}.
\startformula\pagereference[eq:UniversalGrav]
  F = -G\frac{mM}{r^2}
\stopformula
Newton's law of universal gravitation can be used to find the gravitational force between any two objects. It looks almost identical to the formula for gravitational potential energy, but the denominator is $r^2$ instead of $r$. The $r^2$ in the denominator tells us that the force is very small when the distance is large.
%(You already knew that from looking at the energy graph.)
The negative in Newton's law of universal gravitation guarantees that the force is always in the negative $r$ direction, toward Earth.
Lagrange's insight explains the gravitational force. Newton's law of universal gravitation calculates the gravitational force.\pagereference[eq:UniversalGrav]

%The gravitational force is often written $F = -mg$, where $g$ is the strength of the \keyterm{gravitational field}.
%\startformula
%	g = G\frac{M}{r^2},
%\stopformula
%Here on Earth's surface, $g=9.8\units{m/s^2}$. The gravitational field gets weaker with distance because of the $r^2$ in the denominator. The gravitational field formula can be used to find $g$ any distance from any celestial object. Objects with larger mass $M$ have stronger gravitational fields. Less massive objects's, like the Moon have weaker gravitational fields.

Hooke published his law for springs in 1678. Newton presented his law of universal gravitation to the Royal Society in 1686. These two laws were early contributions to the patchwork of methods and principles developed during the seventeenth and eighteenth century. Lagrange's insight was that these laws, and many others, were consequences of the potential energy formulas discovered later by D.~Bernoulli. This insight was just one part of Lagrange's general procedure for mechanics.

Lagrange's general procedure was totally unlike Newton's own methods for working with forces. Newton's \booktitle{Principia} is full of diagrams. Newton's calculations are done with graphical methods, and equations are few. In the preface to his \booktitle{Mécanique Analytique}, Lagrange explains his analytical procedure.
\startblockquote  
No figures will be found in this work. The methods I present require neither constructions nor geometrical or mechanical arguments, but solely algebraic operations subject to a regular and uniform procedure. Those who appreciate mathematical analysis will see with pleasure mechanics becoming a new branch of it and hence, will recognize that I have enlarged its domain.
\stopblockquote
In \booktitle{Mécanique Analytique}, Lagrange used his powerful mathematical analysis to analyze any mechanical system, described using any coordinates. Starting with only the formulas for the system's total kinetic energy and total potential energy. Lagrange's \quotation{regular and uniform procedure} produces a complete set of equations of motion for the system.

Lagrange's \booktitle{Mécanique Analytique} was a stunning achievement, unlike anything physics had seen before. Lagrange was viewed as a hero in France under King Louis \convertnumber{KR}{16}. Luckily, Lagrange's fame transcended the turbulent – often violent – politics of France following the French Revolution in 1789. As governments rose and fell around him, Lagrange continued to play a leading role in the advancement of science and mathematics in France.

Lagrange's equations of motion are a bit more tangled than our position and momentum update formulas, so we will not learn the details of his procedure. A general method for producing position and momentum update formulas was developed later by William Rowan Hamilton. We will need Hamilton's general method to solve the ancient problem of the planets' motions. We will introduce his method later in this chapter to study rotational motions. Then, we will apply Hamilton's method to the planets' elliptical orbits in \in{Chapter}[ch:Rotation]. 

First, however, we will look at circular orbits, which we can study using the tools of uniform circular motion (\at{p.}[sec:uniformcirc]).

\section{Gravitational Field}
Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, presented in the previous section, is a bit intimidating. It is certainly more complicated than the formula $F = -mg$, which we have been using for gravity near Earth's surface (\at{p.}[eq:Fmg]).
Fortunately, we can continue to use this simpler formula if we remember that $g$ is only $\unit{9.8 m/s^2}$ near Earth's surface. At other locations in the solar system, $g$ is larger or smaller. To find the correct value of $g$, we must understand the \keyterm{gravitational field}.

\emph{The gravitational field's magnitude $g$ is the slope of the gravitational potential.}
The gravitational field is smaller far from Earth, where the gravitational potential is less steep.
The gravitational field is largest near Earth, where the gravitational potential is steepest.

The gravitational field is everywhere, surrounding Earth in all directions. \in{Figure}[fig:EarthGravField3D] shows the gravitational field at several locations around Earth. The gravitational field points toward Earth's center, and gets smaller at greater distances.

Near Earth's surface, the gravitational potential's slope is \unit{9.8 m/s^2}, the well known value of $g$ near Earth's surface.
Finding the exact slope of the gravitational potential at other distances is tricky, but the answer is not complicated. At a distance $r$ from a large mass $M$, the gravitational field's magnitude is
\startformula
  g = \frac{GM}{r^2}.
\stopformula
We can use this formula to calculate $g$ here on Earth's surface. On Earth's surface, we are a distance $r = \unit{6.37e6 m}$ from Earth's center. Earth's mass is $M\sEarth = \unit{5.97e24 kg}$. With these values, we find the well known value for $g$ near Earth's surface.
\startformula
  g = \frac{GM\sEarth}{r^2}
    = \frac{(\unit{6.67e-11 m^3/kg s^2})(\unit{5.97e24 kg})}{(\unit{6.37e6 m})^2}
    = \unit{9.8 m/s^2}
\stopformula
The gravitational field's magnitude $g$ will be different in different locations throughout the solar system, depending on the mass $M$ of the object producing the gravitational field and the distance $r$ from the object.

Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation can be found from the simple formula for gravitational force, $F = -mg$, with our new formula for the gravitational field's magnitude $g = GM/r^2$. 
\startformula
  F = -mg
    = -m\left(\frac{GM}{r^2}\right)
    = -G\frac{mM}{r^2}
\stopformula
We will often find it convenient to use the simple formula for gravitational force early in a calculation, and then include the more complicated formula for $g$ later.

I hope you noticed that the relationship just described between gravitational field and gravitational potential is almost identical to Lagrange's relationship between force and potential energy, illustrated in \in{figure}[fig:BoxEarthGravF].
Also notice one important difference:
The gravitational potential energy $U$ and gravitational forces $F$ shown in \in{figure}[fig:BoxEarthGravF] are for a \unit{3.0kg} box. If the box had been \unit{3.0g} or \unit{3000kg}, the gravitational potential energy and gravitational forces would have been a thousand times smaller or larger.
In contrast, the gravitational potential $\Phi$ and the gravitational field $g$ shown in \in{figure}[fig:EarthGravField] are exactly the same for a \unit{3.0g} box, a \unit{3000kg} box, or no box at all!

I have introduces three new gravitational concepts in this chapter: gravitational potential energy, the gravitational potential, and the gravitational field. All of these are related to each other and to gravitational force. Of these, the gravitational potential $\Phi$ is the most fundamental. All of the others follow from it, as shown below.

Each of these four relationships has been described earlier in this chapter.
Take a moment to recall them by finding each relationship in the diagram above. First, the gravitational potential's slope is the gravitational field $g$. Second, a mass $m$ in the gravitational potential $\Phi$ acquires a gravitational potential energy $U = m\Phi$. Third, Lagrange taught us that the potential energy's slope is the force $F$. %(The minus sign in the diagram gives the force its downward direction.)
Fourth, we frequently use the more convenient formula $F = -mg$ to find the gravitational force $F$ on a mass $m$ in the gravitational field $g$.
%The gravitational field and the gravitational force both have direction. The gravitational field is toward lower gravitational potential. The gravitational force is in the direction of toward lower

In the next section we will use these relationships to understand how the Sun holds planets in orbits, specifically looking at circular orbits.


\section{Circular, centered orbits}\pagereference[sec:circulaorbits]%
Galileo observed that planets farther from the Sun take longer to orbit. We can explain this observation using our improved understanding of gravity. First, we will find the speed of a planet orbiting the Sun at a constant distance. Then, we will find the orbit's period.

The massive Sun produces a wide, deep potential well, shown in \in{figure}[fig:PhiTerrestrial3D]. This potential well holds the planets in orbits around the Sun.
The Sun ($\Sun$) is at the center of \in{figure}[fig:PhiTerrestrial3D].
The inner planets are shown at increasing distances along the $r$ axis. (Planet symbols are listed in \in{table}[T:Astrosym] on \at{p.}[T:Astrosym].)
\in{Figure}[fig:PhiTerrestrial3D] is three dimensional to show the gravitational potential $\Phi$ as planets orbit the Sun. The vertical axis in \in{figure}[fig:PhiTerrestrial3D] is gravitational potential. The planets orbit in the horizontal plane at the top of \in{figure}[fig:PhiTerrestrial3D].
%The three dimensional gravitational potential graph will allow us to understand the planets' two dimensional orbits.

\marginTikZ{}{KeplerVenus}{Venus' orbit is an almost perfectly centered circle, making uniform circular motion a good approximation of for Venus. (A gigameter is one billion meters: $1\units{Gm} = 10^9\units{m}$).} % vskip, name, caption

Venus's orbit is circular, as shown \in{figure}[fig:KeplerVenus]. Since Venus stays a constant distance from the Sun, its speed is constant, meaning Venus's motion is uniform circular.
\in{Figure}[fig:KeplerVenus] shows Venus's momentum $p$ at various points along its orbit, as well as the gravitational force $F$ which changes the momentum's direction, keeping Venus in orbit around the Sun.
%Although uniform circular motion was considered natural in Kepler's time, Descartes and Newton taught us that circular motion requires a central force to bend the planet's path into an orbit.
The force required to keep Venus in this circular orbit is given by the centripetal force formula (\at{p.}[eq:centripetalforce]).
\startformula
	F = \frac{pv}{r}
	  = \frac{mv^2}{r}
\stopformula
In this formula, $r$ the radius of Venus's circular orbit and $v$ is Venus's speed. In the last step, Venus's momentum has been replaced with $p=mv$, where $m$ is Venus's mass.

The centripetal force formula gives the \emph{magnitude} of the force required to produce the circular motion, but does not tell us the source of that force.
For orbits in the solar system, this force is the gravitational force, whose \emph{magnitude} is $mg$.
Replacing $F$ with $mg$ in the centripetal force formula allows us to find Venus's speed.
\startformula
  \cancel{m}g = \frac{\cancel{m}v^2}{r}
\stopformula
As is common for orbits, Venus's mass $m$ drops out of the calculation.
Solve this formula for $v$.
Then, replace $g$ with the formula for the gravitational field, $g = GM/r^2$.
(Do not replace $g$ with $\unit{9.8m/s^2}$!)
\startformula
  v = \sqrt{gr\,}
    = \sqrt{\left(\frac{GM}{r^2}\right)r\,}
    = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}
\stopformula
 The Sun produces the field, so we use $GM\sSun = \unit{1.33e20 m^3/s^2}$ from \in{example}[ex:HalleySpeed] (\at{p.}[ex:HalleySpeed]). Venus's distance from the Sun is $r = \unit{1.08e11 m}$.
\startformula
   v = \sqrt{\frac{GM\sSun}{r}}
     = \sqrt{\frac{\unit{1.33e20 m^3/s^2}}{\unit{1.08e11 m}}}
     = \unit{3.50e4m/s}
     = \unit{35.0 km/s}
\stopformula
Venus is moving quite fast!

To complete a cycle around the Sun, Venus must travel the circumference of its orbit. The time $T$ required to complete one cycle is the orbit's circumference divided by Venus's speed.
\startformula%\pagereference[eq:Kepler3rd]
  T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}
    = \frac{2\pi (\unit{1.08e11 m})}{\unit{3.50e4m/s}}
    = \unit{1.94e7 s}
    = 225\units{days}
	%= \frac{2\pi}{\scriptstyle\sqrt{GM}}\,r^{\threehalves}
\stopformula
Venus travels around the Sun in 255 days, faster than Earth's period of 365 days.

To find Venus's speed and period above, we used the centripetal force formula for uniform circular motion. Venus's motion is not perfectly uniform circular, but the results above are still quite accurate.
Other planets' orbits are less circular, and their motions are less uniform. Even so, the calculations above work reasonably well for all of the planets.
The above formula for speed, $v=\scriptstyle\sqrt{GM/r\,}$, tells us that the planets' speeds are faster for smaller orbits and slower for larger orbits.
Not only do farther planets have to complete larger orbits with each cycle, they also travel along those orbits at a slower speed, making the periods of larger orbits much longer than the periods of smaller orbits. 
(The planets' masses have no effect on their periods.)

Using the orbit radii from \in{figure}[fig:VisiblePlanets], you can calculate the planets' periods, and you will get good results.
Mercury's small orbit takes only 88 days.
Mars's larger orbit takes 687 days.
The outer planets' periods are far longer\dash nearly twelve years for Jupiter and almost thirty years for Saturn.
This pattern agrees with Galileo's observation that larger orbits take much longer than smaller orbits.

While circular motion provides a good approximation, accurately understanding the planets' elliptic orbits will require new tools. To acquire these tools, we return to Hamilton in the early nineteenth century.

\section{Hamilton finds momentum from kinetic energy}

Throughout the eighteenth century, physics advanced on the European continent\dash from Leibniz to Lagrange.
In England, however, the situation was dire.
English physicists were ignoring the industrial revolution transforming their civilization, and ignoring the French mathematical revolution transforming physics.
They remained paralyzed by a fanatic devotion to Newton’s cumbersome, geometric methods and continued to hold a grudge over the Leibniz’s calculus and \visviva. This problem persisted until 1812, when a group of young undergraduate students at Cambridge started the Analytical Society, partly as a joke, to study the methods of French analysis. They learned to solve problems using the continental notation and even translated a few important French books and papers into English. The club met for a few years and essentially disappeared after its members graduated and left Cambridge in 1817.

That probably would have been the end of this little revolt, except that one of the members, George Peacock, was appointed in 1817 to write questions for the rigorous Mathematical Tripos exam taken by all third year mathematics students at Cambridge. He audaciously wrote his questions using the continental notation. This caused a bit of grumbling among the faculty, but they did not interfere. Surprisingly, Peacock was asked to write questions again in 1819. Students recognized this as a complete surrender by the Newtonian faculty. From there, the adoption of continental notation and methods in England was quite swift. Newton remained a revered figure, but his 150 year old dispute with Leibniz was finally laid to rest. %Cannell p. 38

Freed from Newton's methods, the United Kingdom began producing great physicists. Among the first was William Rowan Hamilton. Hamilton was a genius, gifted in languages and mathematics. He learned Hebrew, Latin, and Greek from early childhood. At the age of 15 he read Newton’s \booktitle{Principia}, and a two years later the great French work \booktitle{M\'echanique C\'eleste}, by Pierre-Simon Laplace.%Cannell p. 39

In 1823, at the age of 18, Hamilton entered Trinity College Dublin.
Trinity College had adopted the continental notation in 1812, a bit ahead of Cambridge, and used the French textbooks in mathematics and physics courses. Hamilton embraced the abstract approach. He earned top marks in all of his courses and won many awards, which propelled him to a position as head of the Dunsink Observatory, near Dublin. Although the observatory provided ample opportunity for practical astronomy, Hamilton continued to focus on more theoretical interests, first in optics and then in mechanics.

Hamilton wrote two groundbreaking papers on mechanics, \booktitle{On A General Method In Dynamics} in 1834 and \booktitle{Second Essay On A General Method In Dynamics} in 1835. Hamilton's general method produces the equations of motion for any problem in mechanics, just like Lagrange's procedure, but Hamilton's general method is much easier to understand and execute.

Hamilton's insight was that Newton's momentum can be found from D.~Bernoulli's kinetic energy.
In cartesian coordinates, where the kinetic energy is $K=\onehalf mv^2$, Hamilton's method produces Newton's well know momentum formula, $p=mv$. However, Hamilton's method, like Lagrange's, works in any coordinates. For an angular coordinate $\theta$, where the kinetic energy is $K=\onehalf I\omega^2$, Hamilton's method gives the \keyterm{angular momentum} denoted by $L$.
\startformula
  L = I\omega,
\stopformula
where $I$ is the moment of inertia introduced in \in{chapter}[ch:VisViva] (\at{p.}[eq.Krot]).

\startexample[ex:PottersI]
You are building a potter's wheel, which will have a circular, spinning tabletop for making round bowls, cups and vases, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:PottersWheel].

Angular quantities do not need angular units. In the last example, radians simply dropped out of the calculation, as radians can. If the angular velocity had been measured in cycles per second or degrees per second, we would have converted those angular units to radians, and then dropped the radians.
All the other units were carried through the calculation to get the final units of angular momentum, $\unit{kg m^2/s}$. These units are not the same as units for Newton's linear momentum ($\unit{kg m/s}$). 

%Newton's momentum is one of the most successful in physics. Angular momentum is no less significant. Angular momentum joins momentum and energy as the third conserved quantity in mechanics.

\section{Conservation of angular momentum}
Aside from the different units, angular momentum behaves just like Newton's linear momentum.
In the absence of outside forces, a system's angular momentum remains constant.
An outside force that changes the system's angular momentum is called \keyterm{torque}, and is represented by $\tau$ (a lower-case greek tau.)

Conservation of angular momentum looks just like conservation of linear momentum, but with momentum $p$ replaced by angular momentum $L$ and force $F$ replaced with torque $\tau$.
\startformula
  L\si + \tau\Delta t = L\sf
\stopformula
All the problems we have done with linear momentum have similar versions with angular momentum. In every case, we start with the conservation of angular momentum equation.
Since you have so much experience with conservation of momentum, a few examples will suffice to show how the same conservation of momentum law works with angular momentum. Just keep in mind that the quantities are angular quantities whenever you work with an angular coordinate, which may mean different units.

\startexample[ex:PottersThrow]
Your new potter's wheel (with moment of inertial $I= \unit{0.10kg m^2}$), is spinning with angular velocity $\omega = \unit{3.0 rad/s}$. To make your first pot, you grab $\unit{1.7kg}$ of clay and drop it directly in the center of the spinning tabletop, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:PottersThrow]. You do not spin the clay as you drop it, so it has no angular momentum before impact. The clay's moment of inertia is $\unit{0.010kg m^2}$.
There are no outside angular forces on the tabletop and clay. What is the new angular velocity of the tabletop with the clay stuck to it?

With the total angular momentum unchanged, the increased moment of inertia results in a decreased angular velocity. (Rotational kinetic energy is not conserved in this inelastic collision.)

You decide to add an electric motor to spin your potter's wheel. At full speed, the potter's wheel has angular momentum $\unit{0.30 kg m^2 /s}$. 
How much torque must your electric motor provide to spin the potter's wheel from rest to the desired angular velocity in \unit{15s}?

Since we are looking for the time required, conservation of momentum is a good choice. In this case, the motion is angular, so $p$ is angular momentum and $\tau$ is torque.

As the last two example show, angular momentum conservation problems are often exactly like linear momentum conservation problems, except for the slightly different units.  There is one situation, however, where angular momentum is quite different. This occurs when a spinning object changes its shape, thereby changing its moment of inertia. Angular momentum conservation still works in this case, but the result is unlike anything we have seen with linear momentum conservation.

\startexample[ex:MerryGoRound1]
Six kids have gotten a playground merry-go-round spinning, have climbed on, and are standing near the outer edge, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:MerryGoRound1]. The merry-go-round's moment of inertial is $\unit{10 kg m^2}$. The six kids standing near the edge have a total moment of inertia of $\unit{240 kg m^2}$. The merry-go-round is spinning with a reasonable speed of $\unit{1.0 rad/s}$. The kids then pull their way to the center, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:MerryGoRound2], reducing their moment of inertia to just $\unit{15kg m^2}$. (The merry-go-round's moment of inertia remains $\unit{10kg m^2}$.) What is the merry-go-round's new angular velocity?

Changing a system's moment of inertia can dramatically change its angular velocity. In the example above, the kids were able to reduce their distance from the center to about one-quarter of what it was originally. Because the moment of inertial is proportional to $r^2$, reducing their $r$ to one-quarter will reduce their $I$ to one sixteenth!

This increase in angular velocity has a surprising effect on the rotational kinetic energy.
To see this effect, rewrite the rotational kinetic energy formula (\at{p.}[eq.Krot]) in terms of the angular momentum.
\startformula
  K\sub{rot} = \half I\omega^2
    = \half I \left(\frac{L}{I}\right)^2
    = \frac{L^2}{2I}
\stopformula
When there are no external forces acting on the system, the angular momentum is constant, so the changing the system's moment of inertia will also change the rotational kinetic energy.
If the moment of inertia decreases, the rotational kinetic energy will increase. If the moment of inertial increases, the rotational kinetic energy will decrease.
\startexample[ex:MerryGoRound2]
When the children in \in{example}[ex:MerryGoRound1] move to the center of the merry-go-round, what is the system's change in rotational kinetic energy?
\startsolution
Since the angular momentum is constant, this calculation is easiest if we find the angular momentum first.
\startformula
  L = I\omega
    = (\unit{250kg m^2})(\unit{1.0 rad/s})
    = \unit{250kg m^2/s}
\stopformula
Then, we find the initial and final rotational kinetic energies.
\startformula\startmathalignment
\NC K\si \NC= \frac{L^2}{2I\si}
       = \frac{(\unit{250kg m^2/s})^2}{2(\unit{250 kg m^2})}
       = \unit{125 kg m^2/s^2}
       = \unit{125 J} \NR
\NC K\sf \NC= \frac{L^2}{2I\sf}
       = \frac{(\unit{250kg m^2/s})^2}{2(\unit{25 kg m^2})}
       = \unit{1250 J} \NR
\stopmathalignment\stopformula
The rotational kinetic energy increased by a factor of ten! Finally, we find the change in rotational kinetic energy.
\startformula
  \Delta K\sub{rot} = K\sf - K\si
    = K\sf - K\si
    = \unit{1250 J} - \unit{125 J}
    = \unit{1130 J}
\stopformula
The rotational kinetic energy increases $\unit{1130 J}$.

\stopexample

The change in rotational kinetic energy is surprising because there are no external forces (or torques) doing work on the system.
When the moment of inertia changes, the work is being done inside the system. In \in{examples}[ex:MerryGoRound1] and \in[ex:MerryGoRound2], the children do work pulling themselves toward the merry-go-round's center.
Moving toward the center becomes increasingly difficult as the merry-go-round's angular speed increases.
The considerable work done by the children increases the system's rotational kinetic energy dramatically, as calculated above.

Nothing like this happens with linear momentum, because linear momentum is mass times velocity. Objects cannot simply reduce their mass to increase their velocity. Many things do chance their shape and moment of inertia. Ice skaters will pull in their arms to make their spins faster. Gymnasts and divers tuck to flip more quickly.
Slowly rotating air masses become hurricanes or tornados when the air is drawn toward the center by an area of extreme low pressure.
Planets, stars, solar systems, and galaxies rotate much more quickly than the large clouds of gas and dust from which they formed.
Conservation of angular momentum is one of the great drivers of motion in the universe, from the largest galaxies down to subatomic particles.
