Now bring the thread AB with the attached ball into the position AC and set it free [fig.~\ref{fig:InterruptedPendulum2}]; first it will be observed to descend along the arc CBD, to pass the point B, and to travel along the arc BD, till it almost reaches the horizontal CD, a slight shortage being caused by the resistance of the air and of the string; from this we may rightly infer that the ball in its descent through the arc CB acquired an impetus on reaching B that was just sufficient to carry it through a similar arc BC to the same height.\autocite{p.~343-4 for all of the remaining Galileo quotes in this section.}{Galileo1638}
\stopblockquote
As we have seen, attempts to quantify Galileo's impetus caused great confusion because there are \emph{two} quantities, momentum and kinetic energy, that are both important for understanding an object's motion.
With luck, one of these will be the “impetus” acquired in the ball's descent and sufficient for the ball's ascent to the same height.

	Having repeated this experiment many times, let us now drive a nail into the wall\dots say at E [fig.~\ref{fig:InterruptedPendulum3}]\dots so that it projects out some ten to fifteen centimeters in order that the thread, again carrying the ball through the arc CB, may strike upon the nail E when the ball reaches B, and thus compel it to traverse the arc BG, described about E as center. %“five or six inches” changed to “ten to fifteen centimeters.”

The nail at E interrupts that pendulum's swing, and the ball travels up the steeper arc BG.

Galileo noticed that G is the same height as C and D. The interruption does not make G higher by reducing the length of the ascending path, nor does it make G lower by making the path steeper. The “impetus” acquired by the pendulum during its descent from C to B is exactly enough to carry it up the ascent from B to the G.

\startblockquote
	But when the nail is placed so low that the remainder of the thread below it will not reach to the height CD (which would happen if the nail were placed nearer to B than to the intersection of AB with the horizontal CD), then the thread leaps over the nail and twists itself about it.

Huygens, who discovered the conservation of $mv$ and $mv^2$ in pendulum collisions, also studied the colliding pendulums' initial and final heights, and again he discovered something quite remarkable.
Pendulums of different masses may be released from various heights. Then, after the colliding with each other, those masses will ascend to other various heights. Huygens discovered that for elastic collisions the total of the masses times their heights (total $mh$, where $h$ is the mass's height) is the same before and after the collision.

Huygens then related the total $mh$ at release to the total $mv^2$ at the collision, showing that the total $mh$ lost in the masses' descent is proportional to the $mv^2$ right before the collision. Likewise the total $mv^2$ right after the collision is proportional to the total $mh$ gained in the masses' ascent.
%Huygens made all of the observations before Newton introduced momentum, before Leibniz introduced \visviva, and long before the concept of kinetic energy. None the less, we should take a moment to understand his observation in modern physics language.
%Huygens then took on the problem of what happens before the system returns to rest. Galileo had shown that pendulum descends the loss of height is proportional to the increase in square of the pendulum's speed.
%Between the moments of initial and final rest the masses descend and pick up some kinetic energy, exchange that energy in the collisions, and then loose the kinetic energy as they ascend.
Huygens extended his analysis to any system moved by gravity. Whenever the system's total $mh$ decreased, the total $mv^2$ would increase proportionally; when the total $mh$ increased, the total $mv^2$ would decrease proportionally. In Huygens' view, a system in motion always has the potential to ascend to a greater height and come to rest. Even though the system's actual height may be lower, this potential height is conserved. Considering Galileo's interrupted pendulum Huygens would say that as the pendulum swings through B it has the potential to ascend to the line CD, which it does.

Johann Bernoulli, an early advocate for \visviva\, saw the situation from the opposite perspective. To him, the initial heights represented stored \visviva. When the pendulums were released the \visviva\ could emerge during the descent only to return to the stored state during the ascent. In this view the conservation of \visviva\ must take into account the stored \visviva\ in the total $mh$ as well as the total $mv^2$ in the motion. Considering Galileo's interrupted pendulum, Bernoulli would say that the pendulum at C contains potential \visviva, which becomes actual \visviva during the descent to B. This \visviva\ then returns to its stored, potential \visviva\ during the ascent to line CD.

As a practical matter, Huygen's view and Bernoulli's view are interchangeable. The modern view does not prefer either form. Energy is changing from a static state to a moving state and then back. The moving state is kinetic energy. The static form of energy is called potential energy.

The relationship between Huygens' heights and \visviva\ was already getting very complicated when Johann Bernoulli's son, Daniel Bernoulli, decided to solve the problem of motions and pressures in fluids. The younger Bernoulli did not attempt to demonstrate mathematically that Huygen's relationship between total $mh$ and $mv^2$ applies to fluids (or, equivalently, that fluids obey conservation of \visviva). Instead he assumed, as a hypothesis, that this relationship applies to fluids and then used the relationship to make predictions. He describes this project in the introduction to his revolutionary work on fluids, \booktitle{Hydrodynamica}, published in 1738 (two years prior to Du Châtlet's \booktitle{Foundations}).

\startblockquote
	It is amazing how much utility this hypothesis may have in mechanical Philosophy\dots it is the same [hypothesis] that I employed for investigating in fluids the laws of motion arising from their own gravity\dots However, I preferred to adopt this hypothesis with Huygenian rather than Paternal words, and to mark it with the name of \textit{the equality between actual descent and potential ascent,} rather than by that other of \textit{conservation of \visviva,} which some even yet dislike, chiefly in England, I know not by what misfortune.\autocite{p.~12-3.}{DBernoulli1968}
\stopblockquote
The complicated systems of pipes, tanks, and fountains studied by Daniel Bernoulli were vastly more complex than the systems considered by Huygens and the elder Bernoulli, but the energy conservation law Daniel Bernoulli used to analyze these systems is quite simple. In his study of fluids, Daniel Bernoulli was the first to carefully account for the system's kinetic and potential energy, as well as any energy added or removed through the work of outside forces. This careful application of a simple law produced a an abundant harvest of detailed and often surprising predictions.
Daniel Bernoulli refers to these predictions as “theorems” because they each follow logically from the law of conservation of energy.

	The Theorems which are presented are not only new, but the majority are unexpected, of the truth of all of which I was not able to convince myself clearly until I had conducted experiments which removed all my doubt.\autocite{p.~10.}{DBernoulli1968}
\stopblockquote
Every experiment testing these predictions also a tests the conservation law on which these predictions are based. The remarkable agreement between predictions and experiments gave Daniel Bernoulli great confidence in the law of conservation of energy.

\section{Gravitational potential energy}

The complicated systems studied by Huygens and D.~Bernoulli all store energy as \keyterm{gravitational potential energy}. Luckily, we can understand gravitational potential energy by applying D.~Bernoulli's insights to Galileo's simple pendulum experiments. A version of Galileo's pendulum with a $150\units{g}$ mass is shown in figure~\in[fig:GalileoPendulum1].

{\noindent\typesetbuffer[TikZ:GalileoPendulum1]} % figure contents

To perform his experiment, Galileo brings the pendulum to position C where it has some gravitational potential energy.
The symbol for any type of potential energy is $U$. The formula for gravitational potential energy is
\startformula
	U = mgh.
\stopformula
Along with Hugyens' $mh$, this formula includes $g$, which is the same $9.8\units{m/s^2}$ found in the formula for gravitational force, $F = mg$. The $g$ is included because Earth's gravitational attraction makes this energy storage passible. On the moon, where $g$ is smaller, lifting an object requires less work, but it also stores less gravitational potential energy.

%\placefigure[margin][fig:GravPotentialEnergy] % location
%{Gravitational potential energy is proportional to the mass and the height.}	% caption text
%{\externalfigure[chapter05/GravPotentialEnergy][width=144pt]} % File

We will measure the hight $h$ from the equilibrium point at B, as shown on the left side of figure~\in[fig:GalileoPendulum1]. At C the balls height is $16\units{cm}$, so its gravitational potential energy is
\startformula
	U = mgh
		= (0.150\units{kg})(9.8\units{m/s^2})(0.16\units{m})
		= 0.24\units{kg\.m^2/s^2}
		= 0.24\units{J}
\stopformula
The final answer has energy units, as it should. The pendulum at C has $0.26\units{J}$ of gravitational potential energy.

This gravitational potential energy was stored in the ball when Galileo moved the ball from B to C, which required him to do some work on the pendulum.

\startexample[ex:GalileoPendulum1] How much work did Galileo do on the $150\units{g}$ pendulum when he moved it from its equilibrium position at B to the point C, $16\units{cm}$ higher?
\startsolution
	Following Daniel Bernoulli, we start with the law of conservation of energy. The total energy includes both kinetic and potential energy, that is $H\si=K\si+U\si$ and $H\sf=K\sf+U\sf$.
\startformula\startmathalignment
\NC	H\si + W + \cancel{Q}	\NC = H\sf			\NR
\NC	K\si + U\si + W			\NC = K\sf + U\sf	\NR
\stopmathalignment\stopformula
	Since the pendulum starts motionless at B and ends motionless at C, the initial and final kinetic energies are both zero. The initial height of the ball at B is zero, so the initial gravitational potential energy is zero. Only the work and final gravitational potential energy remain.
\startformula\startmathalignment
\NC	\cancel{K\si} + \cancel{U\si} + W	\NC = \cancel{K\sf} + U\sf	\NR
\NC	W							\NC = 0.24\units{J}	\NR
\stopmathalignment\stopformula
	Galileo did $0.24\units{J}$ of work on the pendulum when he moved it from B to C.
\stopsolution
\stopexample

Whenever you are asked to calculate work you should consider using the work formula $W = F_x\Delta x + F_y\Delta y + F_z\Delta z$, but that would have been a poor choice here. You do not know the force Galileo applied and it almost certainly was not a constant force, making this into a calculus problem. Conservation of energy only requires the direct calculation of initial and final energies, which is much easier.

The height $h$ can be measured from the floor, a table top, sea level, or any other convenient reference, as long as that reference stays in place for the entire calculation. A convenient choice is often the lowest point of the motion, like the point B along the path of Galileo's pendulum. The pendulum's gravitational potential energy, calculated from the ball's height, is shown for all heights along the right side of figure~\in[fig:GalileoPendulum1]. Using a different reference point, like the floor, shifts all of the heights on the left and all of the potential energies on the right. However, this would not force Galileo to do more work. No matter where the reference point is, he moves the pendulum from B to C, increasing the height by $16\units{cm}$. This increases the potential energy by $0.24\units{J}$, so he still does $0.24\units{J}$ of work on the pendulum.

\startexample[ex:GalileoPendulum1] Galileo releases the pendulum at point C and it swings through the equilibrium point B. What is the ball's speed as it passes through B?
\startsolution
The descending pendulum's gravitational potential energy will decrease during the descent, and the kinetic energy will increase by the same amount. All of this is accounted for using the law of conservation of energy, this time without any outside force doing work.

In the solution above I asserted that there is no work done by outside forces. You might object – the nail exerts a force on the string, the string exerts a force on the ball, and Earth exerts a downwards for on the ball as well. Any one of these could do work!

However, the nail does no work because it has no displacement. The string is attached to the ball, which does have a displacement, but the displacement is always perpendicular to the force exerted by the string, so the string also does no work. (The nail and string do contribute momentum to the ball, which one reason why we would not want to solve this problem using conservation of momentum.)

The most serious challenge is the Earth's gravitational force, which does do work. We can include that work or not depending on what we chose to include in the system being studied.
%This problem could have been solved using the work done by the gravitational force on the pendulum during the descent from C to B. The difference between my solution and the solution using work is the choice of the system being studied.
The pendulum's kinetic energy is a property of the pendulum. To study pendulum's the motion we must include the pendulum's kinetic energy in our system.

The gravitational potential energy is not actually in the pendulum, nor is it in the Earth which is pulling down on the pendulum. The gravitational potential energy is in the gravitational field surrounding the pendulum. We can chose to include this potential energy in our system or not. If you chose to make the box the only thing in the system, then the gravitational force is an outside force that does work. Since the potential energy is outside the system it does not contribute to the total energy, therefore $H=K$. Using this method the solution looks like this:
	\startformula\startmathalignment
	\NC	H\si + W + \cancel{Q}		\NC = H\sf			\NR
	\NC	\cancel{K\si} + F_y\Delta y	\NC = K\sf			\NR
	\NC	(-mg)(-h)					\NC = \half mv^2	\NR
	\NC	v						\NC = \sqrt{2gh}
						= \sqrt{2(9.8\units{m/s^2})(0.16\units{m})}
							= 0.89\units{m/s}
	\stopmathalignment\stopformula
There are some tricky signs in the middle, but the final answer is exactly the same.
While both methods are acceptable, you should include the gravitational potential energy $U$ in the system.
Daniel Bernoulli taught that including $U$ in the system is both easier and gives us a better insight.

If you include the gravitational potential energy in the system, as I did originally, then the gravitational force is not an external force, it is internal to the system. This force plays a roll in moving energy from one part of the system (the gravitational field) to another part (the box), but it does not add any energy to the system, nor does it remove any energy from the system. That is why there was no external work in my solution.

During the descent and assent the pendulum's energy is split between gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy. The gradual decrease in gravitational potential energy during the descent and the increase during the assent are graphed in figure~\in[fig:GalileoPendulumGraphU]. The energy is shown as a function of the ball's position $s$ along the curved path, as shown in figure\in[fig:GalileoPendulumPath1]. The gravitational potential energy is determined by the height of each position, and can be graphed for all positions along the path. The equilibrium point is the point of lowest potential energy at $s=0\units{cm}$.

Galileo began his experiment by moving the pendulum from the equilibrium position at $s=0\units{cm}$ to the position $s=-37\units{cm}$, as show in figure~\in[fig:GalileoPendulumPath2]. The gravitational potential energy at this release position $U=0.24\units{J}$, as shown on the graph in figure~\in[fig:GalileoPendulumGraphHK]. At the moment of release the pendulum's kinetic energy is $K=0\units{J}$, so its total energy is $H = U + K = 0.24\units{J} + 0\units{J} = 0.24\units{J}$, which is also shown on the energy graph in figure~\in[fig:GalileoPendulumGraphHK].

{The energy graph for Galileo's experiment where he releases the pendulum at $s=-37\units{cm}$.}	% caption text
{\noindent\typesetbuffer[TikZ:GalileoPendulumGraphHK]} % figure contents

Once the pendulum is released it starts moving to the right. Its gravitational potential $U$ decreases and its kinetic energy $K$ increases. The increasing kinetic energy is shown by the curve labeled “$K$” on the graph in figure~\in[fig:GalileoPendulumGraphHK].
Since no work is being done on the system by outside forces, the total energy $H=0.24\units{J}$ stays constant, as shown by the horizontal line labeled “$H$” on the graph in figure~\in[fig:GalileoPendulumGraphHK]. As the potential energy decreases, the kinetic energy increases by exactly the same amount, so that the total energy $H=U+K$ stays constant.

When the pendulum reaches the equilibrium point $s=0\units{cm}$, the potential energy is completely gone. All of the energy is kinetic, as can be seen by the point where the graph of $K$ touches the line $H$ on the graph.

As the pendulum continues upwards, the potential energy increases and the kinetic energy decreases. When the pendulum reaches the position $s=37\units{cm}$, all of the energy is again gravitational potential energy, where the $H$ line touches the graph of $U$ in figure~\in[fig:GalileoPendulumGraphHK]. The pendulum does not have enough energy to go any further. The kinetic energy cannot be negative, so the gravitational potential energy cannot be greater than $H$. The point where the $H=U$ is called a turning point, because the pendulum will reach that point and then turn around moving in the other direction, back towards lower potential energy.

As it swings back from right to left, the gravitational energy again decreases while the kinetic energy increases, until it returns to the equilibrium point. Then the gravitational potential energy increases and the kinetic energy decreases until it reaches the original release point, which is another turning point.

As the pendulum swings back and forth between the turning points and $s=-37\units{s}$ and $s=37\units{cm}$ the energies will continue to follow the curves in figure~\in[fig:GalileoPendulumGraphHK], going right and then left between the turning points.

Energy graphs like this one are extremely useful for understanding motion. They are especially useful for finding turning points and finding speeds at specific locations, something that is often difficult to do with momentum conservation. Energy graphs are not as useful for questions involving time, since everything is graphed as a function of position. In the next section we will introduce two other types of potential energy. You will have the opportunity to work with graphs of these in the problem sets.

%During the descent from C to B the ball's initial $0.24\units{J}$ of gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. Then, during the ascent the $0.24\units{J}$ of kinetic energy is converted back to gravitational potential energy, just enough to bring the ball back to its original height at D. In this experiment Galileo's “impetus” is clearly the ball's kinetic energy which increases during the descent from C to B and which is sufficient to carry the ball up the ascent from B to D.
%
%The gravitational field's ability to store potential energy was a great mystery until Einstein explained that it has to do with the bending of space-time. This is extremely interesting and terribly complicated. Luckily, Daniel Bernoulli showed us how to deal with these sorts of mind-boggling complications: ignore them.
%He did not need to know the details of intermolecular forces in fluids, and you do not need to know the details of space-time bending. Just use the potential energy formula and everything will be fine, provided you are careful to include the potential energy in the system and remember that the gravitational force is an internal force that does no work \emph{on the system.}

\startexample[ex:BalloonLaunch] In their quest for knowledge, physics students launch a water balloon from the top of the school onto the soccer field below. The water balloon has a mass of $0.50\units{kg}$ and is launched with with a speed of $15\units{m/s}$ and an angle $53\degree$ above the horizontal, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:BalloonLaunch}. What is the water ballon's speed when it hits the ground?

	Since energy is not directional there is no need to break anything into components. The balloon speed at impact is not affected by the launch angle. The launch angle will affect the distance and the time aloft, but the impact speed depends only on the initial speed and height.

%Gravitational potential energy was the first form of potential energy to be identified and quantified, but there are other ways to store energy

\section{Spring potential energy}

After completing \booktitle{Hydrodynamica} Daniel Bernoulli developed new applications for his energy principle, and even found new types of potential energy, like the energy stored in a stretched or compressed spring.

The ability to easily store and return energy makes springs incredibly useful.
In some cases the energy stored is quite small. Buttons on a keyboard have tiny springs in them that store some energy when the button is pressed. This energy is used to push the button back up so it is ready to be pressed again.
A bow for firing arrows is a different shape, but it is still a spring. When the string is pulled back the bow stores a larger amount of energy. When the string is released the energy stored in the bow is delivered to the arrow as kinetic energy.

The potential energy stored in a spring depends on the spring's stiffness $k$ and the amount of stretch of the spring $s$. (The spring stiffness is often called the spring constant.)
\highlightbox{
\startformula[eq:1DUspring]
	U\sub{spring} = \half ks^2
\stopformula
}
The stretch must always be measured from the relaxed length of the spring. If the spring is compressed rather than stretched, as in the ball bounce example above, then the “stretch” is negative. However, since the stretch is squared it does not matter whether the stretch is positive or negative; the energy stored is positive either way.

%\section{Energy transformations in oscillations}

Figure \in[fig:SpringCart] shows a small cart attached to a spring, which will behave in a manner similar to Galileo's pendulum. Moving the cart to the left, as shown, requires some work and stores potential energy in the spring. When the cart is released the spring will push the cart back towards the equilibrium point at $s=0\units{cm}$, and the spring's potential energy will get converted to kinetic energy of the cart.

At equilibrium point all of the energy is kinetic. As the cart passes the equilibrium it will slow as its kinetic energy is again turned into spring potential energy, this time in the stretched spring.
The cart will continue to oscillate, with the energy going back-and-forth between the cart and the spring over-and-over again.

The spring's maximum compression is the amplitude of the oscillation. That is the moment when all of the energy is in the spring as potential energy. When the ball passes through the midpoint of the oscillation all of the energy is in the kinetic energy of the ball. Using conservation of energy we can find the maximum speed of the ball (at the midpoint) from the amplitude.

Again we will consider the combined system of the ball and the spring: $H = K+U$. The initial position is at full stretch ($K=0$, $s=A$) and the final position is at the midpoint ($U=0$, $v=v\sub{max}$).
\startformula\startmathalignment
\NC	H\si + \cancel{W} + \cancel{Q}	\NC = H\sf					\NR
\NC	\cancel{K\si} + U\si			\NC = K\sf + \cancel{U\sf}		\NR
\NC	\half k A^2					\NC = \half mv\sub{max}^2	\NR
\NC	A\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}			\NC = v\sub{max}
\stopmathalignment\stopformula
The maximum velocity, right at the midpoint, it proportional to the amplitude.

Recall from our earlier discussion of oscillations that the maximum velocity can also be found from the amplitude and the period.
\highlightbox{
\startformula[eq:vmaxA]
	v\sub{max} = \frac{2\pi A}{T}
\stopformula
}
Combine this formula for $v\sub{max}$ with the formula for $v\sub{max}$ that we found above using conservation of energy.
\startformula
	\cancel{A}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \frac{2\pi \cancel{A}}{T}
\stopformula
Cleaning this up gives a useful formula an oscillator's period $T$.
\highlightbox{
\startformula
	T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
\stopformula
}
The period $T$ depends on the mass of the cart and the stiffness of the spring, but it does not depend on the amplitude of the oscillations. If the oscillations are small, the speed is also small and each cycle takes time $T$. If the oscillations are big the speed is also big and each cycle is still completed in the same time $T$.

This can be used to find the frequency as well
\startformula
	f = \frac{1\units{cyc}}{T} = \frac{1\units{cyc}}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\stopformula
Again, the frequency does not depend on the amplitude, only on the mass and the spring constant. A stiffer spring (larger $k$) will increase the frequency, while a larger mass will lower the frequency.


\section{Gravitational potential energy in the Solar System}

In the year that \booktitle{Hydrodynamica} was published, 1738, Daniel Bernoulli produced a paper on the motion of the Moon, which is pulled by both Earth and the Sun. Gravitational forces in the solar system had already been studied in some detail using Newton's methods of momentum and force, but Daniel Bernoulli attacked the problem using potential and kinetic energy.

The gravitational potential energy formula earlier in this chapter, $U=mgh$, is only useful for relatively small heights near the Earth's surface. Over the long distances between planets, moons, and the sun, the gravitational potential energy is a bit more complicated. The gravitational potential energy of any two objects in the solar system is
\startformula
	U = -G\frac{mM}{r},
\stopformula
where $m$ and $M$ are the objects' masses, $r$ is the distance between the objects' centers, and $G=6.67\sci{-11}\units{m^3/kg\.s^2}$ is the universal gravitational constant.

This formula is a bit intimidating, but extremely valuable if used correctly. First, notice that the distance between the objects is in the denominator. If the distance is extremely large, then their gravitational potential energy is extremely small. This is quite convenient because it means that very distant objects can be ignored. When studying the interaction of the Earth and Moon, it is not necessary to include the gravitational potential energy due to distant stars.

The second thing to notice is that the distance is between the objects' centers. When calculating the gravitational potential energy of an object on the Earth's surface the distance $r$ is Earth's radius ($r\sEarth=6.37\sci{6}\units{m}$) not the height above Earth's surface.

Third, the formula always gives a negative potential energy. This has alarmed many people, including great physicists, but it is not a problem. The gravitational potential energy is zero when the objects are far apart and it goes down as objects get closer together. Down from zero is negative. Kinetic energy is always positive, but there is no reason to be alarmed by negative potential energy.

Finally, the universal gravitational constant $G$ is extremely small, so the gravitational potential energy between every-day objects at every-day distances can be completely ignored. At least one of the objects must have a huge mass in order for the gravitational potential energy to be significant. Earth's mass of $5.97\sci{24}\units{kg}$ is enough to have a significant effect.

Daniel Bernoulli's method has continued to provide insight into every know physical process, from particle interactions to the expansion of the universe. In the centuries since the publication of \booktitle{Hyrodynamica} much of the important progress in physics has come from properly identifying and quantifying the many forms of energy.

%The gravitational potential energy is always negative. There is no reason to be alarmed by this. It is negative because gravity is attractive, so the gravitational potential energy must decrease as objects approach each other. Since the potential energy is close to zero at large distances, the potential energy can only go down by going negative as the objects approach each other. Kinetic energy is always positive, as is the energy stored in a spring, but gravitational potential energy is negative.
