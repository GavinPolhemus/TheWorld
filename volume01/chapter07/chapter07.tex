\Initial{J}{ohannes Kepler,} at the age of 23, became interested in astronomy for a simple reason: it was his job. He had been studying for the priesthood, but he also loved mathematics. Before is graduation in the spring 1594, he received an unexpected invitation to teach mathematics and astronomy at the school in Graz, Austria.
Although Kepler had never thought of becoming an astronomer, he had taken the required astronomy courses at the University of Tübingen. He understood the Ptolemaic and Copernican systems (\at{pp.}[AncientWorldModels]-\at[AncientWorldModelsEnd]). After a bit of hesitation, he accepted the invitation.
 
%Since the Moon, Sun, and Earth are all circular – the most perfect shape – the Pythagoreans believed that all celestial bodies circle Earth, a model that ran into conflicts with observations immediately. To explain the planet's erratic motions across the sky, ancient astronomers introduced compound motion into their models, so that the planets moved on circles which were themselves being carried by other circles.

During his second summer in Graz, Kepler was struck by a novel idea: perhaps the planets' orbits were exactly the right sizes to fit inside nested Platonic solids, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:Kepler1596system]. This idea is wrong, but given the close connection between geometry and astronomy, it was not an especially outlandish proposal in the sixteenth century. More controversial was the fact that he nested these polygons with the Sun at the center and Earth in orbit (in a spherical shell between the model's icosahedron and dodecahedron).
Kepler did not think that these spheres and shapes were physical objects in the solar system. Rather, he viewed them as a mathematical plan for the solar system.
In 1597, he published \booktitle{Mysterium Cosmographicum}, a small book exuberantly announcing his heliocentric model.

\marginTikZ{}{U3D}{The Sun's gravitational potential and the visible planets.} % vskip, name, caption

In \booktitle{Mysterium Cosmographicum}, Kepler argued that the Sun is the driver of the Solar System's motions.
Indeed, this insight was far ahead of its time.
We now know that the gravitational potential well, due to the Sun's enormous mass, produces the forces that keep the planets in their orbits.
Kepler's \quotation{drinking cup}\autocite{Described in a letter to Friedrich, Duke of Wuerttemberg, 27 Feb.~1596. v.~\convertnumber{KR}{13} p.~50.}{KeplerGW} model in \in{figure}[fig:Kepler1596system] even looks like our gravitational potential graph in \in{figure}[fig:U3D].
In our graph, the Sun produces the huge potential well that holds the much lighter planets in their orbits. (The Sun is about one-thousand times more massive than Jupiter, the largest planet.)

The gravitational potential graph in \in{figure}[fig:U3D] shows the first six planets at the correct distances along the $r$-axis. Notice how these distances approximately match the distances to the spherical shells in Kepler's model. The  four inner planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars – are quite close together. Jupiter and Saturn are much further out.
The planets' full orbits are shown in \in{figure}[fig:VisiblePlanets]. The scale in \in{figure}[fig:VisiblePlanets] shows $r$, the distance from the Sun.% and $\theta$ the angle measured around the Sun. (These are commonly called \keyterm{polar coordinates}.)

{The orbits of the six visible planets. (A terameter is one trillion meters: $1\units{Tm} = 10^{12}\units{m}$).}	 % caption text
{\noindent\typesetbuffer[TikZ:VisiblePlanets]} % figure contents

%In the calculations for a circular, centered orbit, we took an illegal short-cut by assuming circular, centered orbits and uniform circular motion. 
The planets' orbits are slightly off center, or \keyterm{eccentric}, as can be seen for most of the planets in \in{figure}[fig:VisiblePlanets]. 
These eccentric orbits lead to changes in each planet's speed.
As a planet gets closer to the Sun on one side of its orbit, the planet's gravitational potential energy decreases and its kinetic energy increases, increasing its speed. As the planet gets farther from the Sun on the other side of its orbit, some of its kinetic energy gets converted back to gravitational potential energy, and the planet slows down. This speeding up and slowing down repeats with every orbit.
The planet's motion is not uniform circular.
The eccentric orbit is a compound motion, combining angular motion around the Sun with oscillating radial motion. 

The orbits' eccentricities and changing speeds were already apparent in Copernicus's model based on ancient observations, but neither the ancients nor Copernicus knew the cause. Kepler tried to accommodate the eccentric orbits and changing speeds in his model, but his own calculations showed that his model was not as accurate as he had originally hoped. However, he correctly recognized the Sun's important role as the center and the physical driver of the solar system.
Kepler sent copies of \booktitle{Mysterium Cosmographicum} to prominent astronomers, including Galileo. Galileo sent an encouraging reply, but it is not clear if he ever read the book before his own adventure with the spyglass fourteen years later.

\booktitle{Mysterium Cosmographicum} did catch the attention of another astronomer, Tycho de Brahe. Tycho had been making precise observations of the positions of stars and planets for 35 years. After a spat with King Christian of Denmark in 1597, Tycho moved his formidable arsenal of observing equipment to a castle near Prague, where he became Imperial Mathematicus for Emperor Rudolf II. Even with the best assistants, Tycho was struggling to make a coherent mathematical model from his mountain of precise data. He did not believe Kepler's model was the solution, but Tycho recognized the young astronomer's tremendous mathematical skill and creativity. Kepler, in return, recognized Tycho's observations as the only firm foundation for his model.
Tycho invited Kepler to collaborate, but guarded his data jealously. Kepler expressed interest, and even made a visit, but was reluctant to leave his position in Graz.

In 1600, events intervened. Kepler was expelled from Graz in a religious purge. Tycho's top assistant left after failing to explain Mars's eccentric orbit. Kepler joined Tycho's team and Tycho granted access to his treasury of Mars observations. Kepler said he would explain Mars's orbit in eight days.
Kepler then worked diligently for eight months. Tycho died in 1601, and Kepler succeeded him as Imperial Mathematics, still without a solution for Mars's orbit.

\noindent
Kepler recounts his struggle with Mars in his revolutionary \booktitle{New Astronomy.} His first model for Mars's orbit uses a perfect circle and constant angular velocity \quotation{in imitation of the ancients.}\autocite{p.~47.}{Kepler1609}
He combines these two ancient ideas in a novel way. He chooses a perfect circle for the orbit of Mars, but places that circle so that the Sun is not at the center. This matches the shape of Mars's orbit quite well. To get the correct speed, he uses constant angular velocity, but not around the circle's center, or around the Sun, but instead around a third point called the equant, shown in \in{figure}[fig:KeplerMarsAncients]. Constant angular velocity around the equant gives Mars a changing velocity along its orbit. When Mars is closer to the equant – and farther from the Sun – it will move along its orbit more slowly. When it is farther from the equant – and closer to the Sun – it will move more quickly.

Before he could check this model he needed to determine the orbit's center and radius and the equant's location. He used four of Tycho's observations in an extremely laborious calculation, explained in chapter 16 of \booktitle{New Astronomy.} At one point in the explanation he exclaims,

\startblockquote
If this wearisome method has filled you with loathing, it should more properly fill you with compassion for me, as I have gone through it at least seventy times at the expense of a great deal of time, and you will cease to wonder that the fifth year has now gone by since I took up Mars\dots.%, although the year of 1603 was nearly all given over to optical investigations.
\autocite{p.~190.}{Kepler1609}
\stopblockquote
We still have these calculations, in Kepler's small handwriting, filling nine hundred pages!

Then, to confirm the model, he used it to predict Mars's location on the dates of six other observations, and compared them to Tycho's records. This again required tremendous labor. All of the predictions agreed with the observations to remarkable precision. Tycho's observations were not perfect, of course, but they could be trusted to within two minutes of an arc. A minute of arc is one sixtieth of a degree. The full Moon's apparent diameter is about thirty minutes of arc, or half of a degree, so Tycho's observations were accurate to within about one fifteenth of the Moon's apparent diameter. Prior observations, going back to the Babylonians, were good only to ten minutes of an arc. Kepler's prediction for Mars's location matched Tycho's observations with an error of less than two minutes – exactly the range of error expected based on the observations' precision. These exciting results are presented in Kepler's chapter 18.

Chapter 19 begins, \quotation{Who would have thought it possible? This hypothesis, so closely in agreement with [chapter 18's] observations, is nonetheless false\dots.}\autocite{p.~208.}{Kepler1609}
Kepler then explains, in methodical detail, that a few additional predictions disagreed with Tycho's observations by up to eight minutes of an arc, or about one quarter of the Moon's apparent diameter. This is a tiny error! Prior to Tycho's observations, such an error could be attributed to the observations. But Tycho's observations were good to two minutes. A difference of eight minutes could only mean the failure of the model.

After years of work, Kepler responds to this devastating verdict with the most moving passage I have found in any science text.
\startblockquote
Since the divine benevolence has vouchsafed us Tycho Brahe, a most diligent observer, from whose observations the $8'$ error of this [model] is shown in Mars, it is fitting that we with thankful mind both acknowledge and honor this favor of God. For it is in this that we shall carry on, to find at length the true form of the celestial motions, supported as we are by the proofs showing our suppositions to be fallacious. In what follows, I shall myself, to the best of my ability, lead the way for others on this road. For if I had thought I could ignore eight minutes\dots I would have already made enough of a correction in Ch.~16. Now, because they could not be ignored, these eight minutes alone will have led the way to the reformation of all of astronomy\dots.\autocite{p.~211.}{Kepler1609}
\stopblockquote
If I had to point to a single moment when the old philosophical reasoning gave way to a new scientific practice, it would be this moment – when Kepler, after years of calculation, confronts the data proving his failure, gives thanks, and starts over.

\section{Kepler's area law}
Kepler could have continued \quotation{in imitation of the ancients} by adding a small extra wheel to the orbital motion or by adding a mysterious oscillation to the already mysterious equant. Instead, he recognized that a fundamental assumption of his model must be wrong.
\startblockquote
Therefore, something among those things we had assumed must be false. But what was assumed was: that the orbit upon which the planet moves is a perfect circle; and that there exists some unique point [the equant]\dots about which point Mars describes equal angles in equal times. Therefore, of these, one or the other or perhaps both are false, for the observations used are not false.
\autocite{pp.~209-10.}{Kepler1609}
\stopblockquote
In chapter 20, Kepler shows that any attempt to use an equant will conflict with the observations.
\startblockquote
The blame for the discrepancy\dots(I am repeating this over and over so that it will be remembered) falls entirely upon the faulty assumptions deliberately entertained by me, in common with Tycho and all who have ever devised hypotheses. For the necessary consequence of this enquiry is that there is no single fixed point\dots about which the planet always sweeps out equal angles in equal times.\autocite{pp.~215-16.}{Kepler1609}
\stopblockquote
The model's failure for Mars called into question Kepler's model for Earth's motion, which also used a perfectly circular orbit and constant angular velocity. Kepler could not possibly make any progress in determining the position of Mars from Tycho's observations if he did not even know Earth's location, since Earth is where Tycho made the observations.
Kepler continued to believe that Earth's orbit is a perfect circle, slightly off center from the Sun (\in{fig.}[fig:KeplerTerestrial]), but he needed to find a new rule for Earth's speed. To do this, he again used Tycho's observations of Mars, but this time he reversed them to find the direction Earth would be seen from an observatory on Mars. This seems like a waste of time, since Mars position is also uncertain, but by using multiple observations of Mars when it was known to be in the same position, Kepler was nonetheless able to find Earth's motion. The details of the epic calculations fill chapters 22 through 31 of \booktitle{New Astronomy}.

Knowing Earth's positions, and therefore its speed along its orbit, Kepler sought a mathematical model. Breaking with tradition, he did not seek inspiration in abstract geometry. Instead, he considers possible physical causes for the motion. \quotation{Physicists, prick your ears\dots for we are going to invade your territory.}\autocite{p.~329.}{Kepler1609} 
He no longer searches for imaginary wheels or imaginary points like the equant. Instead he looks for an explanation in the objects themselves, specifically in the Sun and planets.

\quotation{The power that moves the planets resides in the Sun,}\autocite{p.~278.}{Kepler1609} he suggests, and its strength diminishes as the planet gets farther away, decreasing the planet's speed. He attempts to develop this physical idea into a mathematical model and – after considerable stumbling – discovers that all along its orbit, Earth sweeps out \emph{equal areas in equal times.}

For Earth's nearly centered orbit there is only a tiny difference between a constant angular velocity (which sweeps out equal angles in equal times) and Kepler's new law of equal areas in equal times. Tycho's precise observations confirmed the tiny effect of Kepler's new area law for Earth's motion.

Kepler's area law, discovered first for Earth, is true for all planets. The effect is most pronounced for Mercury, which has the most eccentric orbit. Two shaded areas in \in{figure}[fig:KeplerTerestrial] show the areas swept out by Mercury during two equal times. The shaded, pie-shaped area above the Sun shows the area swept out by Mercury during the twenty days when it is closest to the Sun. The shaded area below the Sun shows the area swept out during the twenty days when Mercury is farthest from the Sun. The upper pie-slice has a smaller radius and a larger angle due to Mercury's higher speed near the Sun. The lower pie slice has a larger radius and a smaller angle due to Mercury's lower speed farther from the Sun. The two resulting areas are exactly the same.

Kepler's mysterious area law provides an interesting challenge for any theory of motion. Newton, to show the power of his laws of motion, takes on this challenge in Proposition 1 of the \booktitle{Principia}, where he proves the area law using geometric methods. Euler and Lagrange offered new perspectives on this law in their formulations of mechanics.
We will explain the area law using angular momentum, which is ideally suited to the orbital motions of the solar system.

\section{Conservation of angular momentum}
We will describe the planets' motions with the astronomers' coordinates $r$ and $\theta$ in \in{figure}[fig:polar], with the Sun at the center. These are called \keyterm{polar coordinates}. A planet's motion around the Sun is described by the position update formula for the angular coordinate $\theta$.

\noindent
If the angular velocity $\omega$ were constant, each small step $d\theta$ would be the same size. 
However, the angular velocity is not constant. The correct angular velocity is found from conservation of angular momentum.
\startformula
  L\si + \tau ∆t = L\sf
\stopformula
The central Sun's gravitational force pulls each planet directly toward the center, in the negative $r$ direction. The planets do not feel any torque $\tau$ in the clockwise or counter-clockwise $\theta$ direction.
With no torque, each planet's angular momentum $L$ is constant.

For a circular orbit and a constant distance $r$, the constant angular momentum produces a constant angular velocity (\at{p.}[sec:circulaorbits]). But the planets' orbits are eccentric, $r$ is not constant, and the angular velocity changes as the planets get nearer to the Sun and then farther away. 

\startexample[ex:EarthDistances]
Earth's angular velocity around the Sun varies slightly, from $\unit{2.059e-7rad/s}$ in early January to $\unit{1.926e-7rad/s}$ in early July. Earth is closest to the Sun in early January, when the distance is $\unit{1.471e11m}$. What is Earth's greatest distance from the Sun?
\startsolution
Use conservation of angular momentum to relate the changing angular velocity to the changing distance. We will go from the closest point, where Earth's angular velocity is greatest, to the farthest point, where Earth's angular velocity is lowest.
\startformula\startmathalignment
\NC  L\si + \cancel{\tau∆t} \NC= L\sf \NR
\NC  I\si\omega\si \NC= I\sf\omega\sf \NR
\NC  mr\si^2\omega\si \NC= mr\sf^2\omega\sf \NR
\stopmathalignment\stopformula
\startformula
  r\sf = r\si\sqrt{\frac{\omega\si}{\omega\sf}}
       = \unit{1.471e11m}\sqrt{\frac{\unit{2.059e-7rad/s}}{\unit{1.926e-7rad/s}}}
       = \unit{1.521e11m}
\stopformula
At its farthest point, Earth is only slightly farther away from the Sun.
\stopsolution
\stopexample

Since a planet's constant angular momentum is $L = I\omega = mr^2\omega$, the planet's angular velocity is 
\startformula
  \omega = \frac{L}{mr^2}
    = \frac{l}{r^2}
\stopformula
Since the planets' orbits are not affected by the planets' masses, I have introduced the \keyterm{specific angular momentum}, $l = L/m$.
In physics and chemistry, the term \quotation{specific} means \quotation{per mass.} (You may remember specific heats from chemistry.) Specific angular momentum is conserved just like other momentums. The units of specific angular momentum are $\unit{m^2/s}$, or area per time, suggesting a close connection with Kepler's area law.

The angular velocity $\omega = l/r^2$ allows us to find the correct position update formula for $\theta$ as the planet's distance $r$ changes.
\startformula
  d\theta = \omega\,dt
    = \frac{l}{r^2}\,dt
\stopformula
Even as the specific angular momentum remains constant, the size of the angular steps $d\theta$ change as the planet moves closer and farther from the Sun. The angular steps are larger when the planet is closer to the Sun and $r$ is smaller; the angular steps are smaller when the planet is farther from the Sun and $r$ is larger\dash exactly the speeds Kepler sought to model, first with the equant and then with his constant area law.

To see how our $\theta$ update formula compares with Kepler's area law, we can write the area law as an area update formula.
\startformula
	dA = (\text{const.})\,dt,
\stopformula
where $dA$ is a small change in area that occurs during the short duration $dt$, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:dA]. Kepler observed that equal areas are swept out in equal times, so the coefficient relating the area to the time must be a constant.

\marginTikZ{}{dA}{The small area $dA$ swept out by Earth during a small duration $dt$.} % vskip, name, caption

In polar coordinates, the small area swept out by a planet is a long, thin triangle with length $r$ and width $r\,d\theta$. The thin triangle's area is
\startformula
	dA = \half (r)(r\,d\theta)
		= \half r^2\,d\theta.
\stopformula
We calculated the update $d\theta$ above, and we can use it here.
\startformula\pagereference[eq:AreaUpdate]
	dA = \half \cancel{r^2}\frac{l}{\cancel{r^2}}\,dt.
		= \half l\,dt.
\stopformula
Since the specific angular momentum $l$ is a constant of the motion, this is exactly Kepler's area law stating that equal areas $dA$ are swept out in equal times $dt$. Kepler's area law is the earliest description of conservation of angular momentum.

Now that we understand Earth's changing speed in terms of angular momentum, let's return to Kepler. 
With his new area law, Kepler had more precise positions for Earth, and he returned to the problem of Mars. His new effort is described in Book Five of \booktitle{New Astronomy}.

Mars's more eccentric orbit provides a more difficult challenge for Kepler's area law. \in{Figure}[fig:KeplerTerestrial] shows the areas swept out by Mars in the twenty days when it is farthest from the Sun (right) and the twenty days when it is closest (left). Once again, equal areas are swept out in equal times. Kepler checked areas along other parts of Mars's orbit, and all confirmed his area law.

The areas swept out by Mars are not the same as the areas swept out by Mercury. Both planets have constant specific angular momentum, but Mars's specific angular momentum is about twice Mercury's, so Mars sweeps out about twice the area that Mercury does in the same time. You can roughly check this by measuring the areas in \in{figure}[fig:KeplerTerestrial].

\section{Energy graphs for orbits}
Each planet's orbit is a compound motion. The planet moves around the Sun in the $\theta$-direction while also approaching and receding from the Sun in the $r$-direction. In the last section, we found the surprisingly simple update formulas for the angular motion. In this section we turn our attention to the puzzling motion in the radial direction. Energy graphs will be essential.

\marginTikZ{}{Uterrestrial3D}{The gravitational potential of the inner planets, with their approximate distances from the Sun. The inner planets' full orbits are shown in \in{figure}[fig:KeplerTerestrial].} % vskip, name, caption

The energy graph in \in{figure}[fig:Uterrestrial3D] shows the gravitational potential for the inner planets. Above the graph are the central Sun and the inner planet's at their approximate distances. The gravitational potential alone does not offer much insight into the orbits. It looks as if the planets will spiral down the deep potential well and crash into the Sun! Fortunately, this does not happen due to the planets' angular motion. 
We can see the role of the angular motion by adding angular kinetic energy $K_\theta$ to each planet's energy graph.

Each planet's angular momentum $L$ is constant, but each planet's angular kinetic energy is \emph{not} constant.
\startformula
  K_\theta = \frac{L^2}{2I}
    =  \frac{L^2}{2mr^2}
\stopformula
We see from this formula that as a planet approaches the Sun, toward smaller $r$, its angular kinetic energy $K_\theta$ increases. As the planet moves away from the Sun, toward larger $r$, its angular kinetic energy $K_\theta$ degreases.

{Earth's rotational kinetic energy $K_\theta$ and potential energy $U$ plotted as functions of the distance from the Sun $r$.

Earth's energy graph, in \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKU], shows the angular kinetic energy $K_\theta$ along with the gravitational potential energy $U$. (This energy graph shows only the $r$-direction, not the $\theta$-direction.) The gravitational potential energy $U$ at the bottom should look familiar – rising toward zero far from the Sun and descending steeply close to the Sun.
Earth's angular kinetic energy trends in the opposite direction – descending toward zero far from the Sun and rising steeply close to the Sun, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKU].

Since gravitational potential energy and angular kinetic energy change in opposite directions, these energy changes balance when Earth's distance from the Sun changes slightly along its slightly eccentric orbit.
As Earth moves slightly toward the Sun, some gravitational potential energy is converted to angular kinetic energy. As Earth recedes slightly away from the Sun, some angular kinetic energy is converted back to gravitational potential energy. (The angular momentum $L$ stays constant during these energy changes.)

The angular kinetic energy graph is not \emph{exactly} the opposite the gravitational potential energy graph. The angular kinetic energy $K_\theta$ has $r^2$ in the denominator, while the gravitational potential energy $U$ has only $r$ in the denominator. This makes the angular kinetic energy's behavior a bit sharper than gravitational potential energy's. Angular kinetic energy rises more sharply close to the Sun, and falls off more sharply far away. As a result, there is only one distance where the changes in energy balance, so that the sum stays the same.

The last curve on Earth's energy graph in \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKU] is this sum of the gravitational potential energy and the angular kinetic energy.
\startformula
	U + K_\theta = -G\frac{mM}{r} + \frac{L^2}{2mr^2}
\stopformula
This curve increases sharply close to the Sun, due to the sharp rise in the angular kinetic energy $K_\theta$. The curve also rises towards zero far from the Sun, where the sharper drop in angular kinetic energy allows the more persistent rise of gravitational potential energy $U$ to dominate.

In the middle is a minimum which cradles Earth, as shown by the Earth and Sun above the energy graph, and by the total energy $H$ marked at Earth's location on the graph.
Earth rocks gently in this minimum, where the two energy curves' slopes are in balance. At this minimum, the slope of the total $U + K_\theta$ is zero. Earth's total energy $H$ is very close to this minimum value of $U+K_\theta$. (The contribution of Earth's radial kinetic energy $K_r$ is too small to be seen on this graph. In the next section, Mars will help us understand the role of $K_r$.) Earth does not have enough energy to climb either side of the $U+K_\theta$ minimum, so Earth's orbit is stable.

\marginTikZ{}{UK3D}{Earth's full orbit around the Sun and Earth's energy graph. Earth's orbit is at the minimum of $U + K_\theta$.} % vskip, name, caption

Earth's full orbit is shown on the energy graph in \in{figure}[fig:UK3D], where the $\theta$ direction has been restored. This graph reminds me again of Kepler's early drinking cup model, where Earth's orbit was confined to a spherical shell between two platonic solids (\at{p.}[fig:Kepler1596system]). In our energy graph, Earth's orbit is held between two competing energies. Rising gravitational potential energy surrounds Earth's orbit, preventing Earth from wandering out of the Solar System. Rising angular kinetic energy sits inside Earth's orbit, preventing Earth from spiraling into the Sun.

\section{Specific energy and specific angular momentum}
In order to compare the different planets on a single energy graph, I plotted the energy per mass of each planet, as you can see by looking at the vertical axis on \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKUH]. The energies on this graph represent the energies of each kilogram of the planet, not the energies of the entire planet. Even so, the energies are quite large. For example, each kilogram of Earth\dash and each kilogram of you\dash has a kinetic energy $K_\theta = \unit{4.44e8J}$ due to our high velocity around the Sun.

The energy graph in \in{figure}[fig:CircularH] shows the gravitational potential energy and a dotted line at $-GM/2r$. Each dot represents the total energy of a possible circular orbit. Dots toward the upper right represent larger orbits with greater angular momentum and higher energy. These are the orbits of the outer planets. Dots toward the lower left represent smaller orbits with less angular momentum and lower energy. These are the orbits of the inner planets.

Every planet is in the Sun's gravitational potential well, labeled $\Phi$ in \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKUH].
The size of the centrifugal barrier in the middle of the graph depends on the planet's specific angular momentum. Greater specific angular momentum increases the size of the centrifugal barrier.
A larger centrifugal barrier pushes the planet's orbit farther out from the Sun, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKUH]. Less specific angular momentum produces a smaller centrifugal barrier, allowing the planet to orbit closer to the Sun, as for Mercury. The size of the centrifugal barrier is different for each planet, giving their orbits different sizes in the same gravitational potential well.

The four inner planets are shown at their correct distances from the Sun along the top of \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKUH].
Take a moment to locate Venus and Earth, and compare the specific energy graphs for these two planets. Earth's is the same $\Phi+k_\theta$ curve shown in \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKU].
The $\Phi+k_\theta$ curve for Venus is a similar shape, but shifted down toward lower specific energy and left toward smaller $r$.
This shift is due to Venus's lower angular momentum.
Lower angular momentum gives Venus a lower specific angular kinetic energy $k_\theta = l^2/2r^2$, which is why Venus's $\Phi+k_\theta$ curve in \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKUH] is lower than Earth's.

Like Earth, Venus sits right near the minimum of its $\Phi+k_\theta$ graph, always staying nearly the same distance from the Sun in a nearly circular, centered orbit. The dotted line in \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKUH] shows the radius and specific energy of every possible circular, centered orbit.
This dotted line passes right through the minimum of every $\Phi+k_\theta$ curve.
Earth and Venus sit on this line, since they are both in nearly circular, centered orbits.

Mercury has much less angular momentum, so its $\Phi+k_\theta$ curve is even lower and farther left than Venus's, putting Mercury much closer to the Sun. Unlike Venus and Earth, Mercury's orbit is quite eccentric. Mercury does not sit right at the minimum of its $\Phi+k_\theta$ curve. Mercury's total specific energy $h=\Phi+k_\theta+k_r$, shown by the thick, short, horizontal line labeled \quotation{Mercury,} is somewhat higher than the minimum of the $\Phi+k_\theta$ curve. This looks very much like the energy graph for a simple harmonic oscillator, and Mercury does indeed oscillate in the $r$ direction as it orbits the Sun.
Mercury's oscillations have a period of 88 days.

The endpoints of Mercury's total specific energy line are Mercury's turning points. The left end of the line represents Mercury's closest approach to the Sun, and the right end represents Mercury's greatest distance from the Sun. This range of distances is shown by the range of positions for Mercury at the top of \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKUH].
Between the turning points, Mercury is moving in the $r$ direction as well as in $\theta$ direction. Mercury's radial motion requires some specific kinetic energy $k_r = \onehalf v_r^2$. No outside force does any work on Mercury, so Mercury's total specific energy $h=\Phi+k_\theta+k_r$ is constant as Mercury oscillates between the turning points.

Mars has the most specific angular momentum of the planets in \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKUH], making it farthest from the Sun.
Like Mercury, Mars has an eccentric orbit and does not sit at the minimum of the $\Phi+k_\theta$ curve. The thick, horizontal line labeled \quotation{Mars} shows Mars's total specific energy $h$ as it oscillates between the two turning points on the $\Phi+k_\theta$ curve.
Mars oscillates over a significant range of distances from approximately $r\sub{min}=\unit{2 Gm}$ to $r\sub{max}=\unit{2.5 Gm}$, as shown by the range of Mars positions above the specific energy graph. These turning points in the specific energy graph are same maximum and minimum distances of Mars's orbit shown in \in{figure}[fig:KeplerTerestrial]. 
The minimum of Mars's $\Phi+k_\theta$ curve is much wider and shallower than the minimum of Mercury's curve, so Mars oscillates much more slowly than Mercury. Mars's oscillations have a period of 687 days.

If you look closely at Earth's specific energy graph in \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKU] or \in[fig:EnergyGraphKUH], you will see that Earth's total specific energy $h$ is also a small line segment showing the Earth's small range of distances from the Sun.
Venus's range of distances is even smaller\dash barely visible in \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKUH].

%Mars's more eccentric orbit leads to a more interesting energy graph, shown in \in{figure}[fig:EnergyGraphKUHMars]. Mars's energy graph shows the total energy $H$, including the kinetic energy $K_r$ due to Mars's motion in the $r$-direction. The total energy $H$ is slightly higher than the minimum of $K_\theta+U$, allowing 

Mars's full specific energy graph is shown in \in{figure}[fig:UKMars3D]. The orbit's eccentricity is clearly visible. The extra specific radial kinetic energy $k_r$ responsible for this eccentric motion has raised the total energy $h$ above the $\Phi + k_\theta$ minimum, as if some water (shown in white) had been added to the moat around the central centrifugal barrier. As Mars circles the Sun, its orbit (shown in black) crosses this moat between the outer shore at $r\sub{max}$ on the right side of the centrifugal barrier, and the inner shore at $r\sub{min}$ on the left side of the centrifugal barrier.

\marginTikZ{}{UKMars3D}{A planet with angular momentum will not crash into the Sun, it will orbit.} % vskip, name, caption

If Mars were somehow given more specific radial kinetic energy $k_r$, the total specific energy $h$ would be higher, raising the level of the moat. This would make the moat wider. Mars's orbit, still traveling between the two shores, would be even more eccentric.

The specific energy graph shows the full compound motion discovered by Kepler. The Sun's mass produces the gravitational potential well that keeps the planets from leaving the solar system. Each planet's conserved angular momentum produces a centrifugal barrier that keeps the planet from spiraling into the Sun. The balance between the gravitational potential and the centrifugal barrier determines the approximate radius of the orbit. Additional specific radial kinetic energy determines the eccentric orbit's exact $r\sub{min}$ and $r\sub{max}$.

\section{Orbits are elliptic}
\startblockquote
With the eccentricity and the [orbit's radius] established with the utmost certainty, it might appear strange to an astronomer that there remains yet another impediment in the way of astronomy's triumph\dots. Nevertheless\dots. \autocite{p.~336.}{Kepler1609}
\stopblockquote
During the years of work on the orbits of Mars and Earth, Kepler had developed unmatched skill in geometry and computation. He was testing many more predictions against Tycho's observations. The area law provided the correct speed for Mars along its orbit, but in some places the orbit was deviating from a circle.
Having already abandoned constant angular velocity, Kepler was forced to also abandon the ancients' circular orbits. \quotation{The orbit of the planet is not a circle but of an oval shape.} \autocite{p.~338.}{Kepler1609}

This presented a huge computational challenge.
Kepler's geometrical methods depend on the geometry of a circle. He needed to find a new shape, but did not know what it should be. He tried some slightly pointy egg shapes, but needed to study many more observations to determine exactly how long and pointy the egg should be.

At one point in this dreadful analysis he writes to a friend, \quotation{if only the shape were a perfect ellipse all of the answers could be found in Archimedes' and Appollonius' works.}\autocite{v.~\convertnumber{KR}{14} p.~409.}{KeplerGW}
Ellipses are circles squashed symmetrically, no pointier at one end than the other. These had been studied extensively by the ancient Greeks. Almost anything that could be done with a circle had also been worked out for ellipses, which would make Kepler's work much easier. Alas, for his egg shape almost nothing was known. Kepler struggled to make progress. The struggle with the egg fills eleven chapters (45-55) of \booktitle{New Astronomy.} In the process he computes an impressive table of twenty-eight different observations of Mars, from 1582 to 1595, with Mars's distance from the Sun, position along its orbit, predicted position in the sky, its observed position, and the error. Many of the errors were several minutes – huge errors by Kepler's standards – causing the egg to \quotation{go up in smoke.}\autocite{p.~406.}{Kepler1609}

Kepler starts over again, using his table of twenty-eight distances. While considering these distances, he was playing around with another calculation and stumbled upon the number $1.00429$, which reminded him of one of the distances, which was off of the circle by $0.00432$. \quotation{It was as if I were awakened from a sleep to see a new light\dots.}\autocite{p.~407.}{Kepler1609}
He tried the same formula for other observations and it again gave the right distances! He did not realize that formula gives the distances on an ellipse, since he had simply stumbled on the formula while doing something else. As a result, he put these correct distances at the wrong positions and produced an orbit that was \quotation{puff-cheeked}\autocite{p.~428.}{Kepler1609} and did not match the observations. He therefore abandoned the formula to try something entirely new – an ellipse!
\startblockquote
Why should I mince words? The truth of Nature, which I had rejected and chased away, returned by stealth through the backdoor, disguising itself to be accepted. That is to say, I laid [the distance formula] aside, and fell back on ellipses, believing that this was quite a different hypothesis, whereas the two, as I will prove in the next chapter, are one and the same\dots.\autocite{p.~388.}{Kepler1609}
\stopblockquote
The ellipse provided exactly the formula he had stumbled upon and then abandoned. The ellipse also provided the correct angles and unlocked a wealth of geometric knowledge from ancient geometers. \quotation{Oh, ridiculous me!} \autocite{p.~430.}{Kepler1609}

As Kepler described, he did not recognize this formula as an ellipse, and you probably do not recognize it either. Even if you have studied ellipses is a mathematics course, you probably saw it described in terms of the semi-major axis $a$ and semi-minor axis $b$, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:MathEllipse]. This ellipse is exactly the same shape as the ellipse described by Kepler's distance formula, although it is not easy to prove that they are the same. Kepler gives his proof in Chapter 59 of \booktitle{New Astronomy}.
The only relationship we need between these two descriptions of the ellipse is the obvious equality of the major axis.

\placefigure[margin][fig:Kepler1609Urania]{Woodcut from Kepler's \booktitle{New Astronomy} showing the elliptic orbit which explains the motion on Mars. The diagram includes Urania, the muse of astronomy, arriving on her 
triumphal chariot with a laurel wreath – a crown for Kepler to honor his victory over the war god, Mars.} {\externalfigure[Kepler1609Urania][width=\rightmarginwidth]}

Kepler finishes \booktitle{New Astronomy} with a detailed discussion of ellipses' properties and their application to Mars's orbit. His woodcut diagram is shown in \in{figure}[fig:Kepler1609Urania]. Kepler had finally triumphed over Mars.
All that remained was to triumph over the process of getting \booktitle{New Astronomy} actually published, which took another four years.

Kepler believed that his mathematical model of Mars's motion – the area law on an elliptic orbit – would apply to all of the planets. He was right. Telescopes, which were not available to Tycho or Kepler, allowed far more precise observations. Kepler's model continued to provided excellent predictions, not only for the planets' nearly circular orbits, but also for the highly elliptic orbits of comets like Halley's Comet, shown in \in{figure}[fig:HaleysComet].

Elliptic orbits do not have a constant radius, so the formulas for angular momentum and total energy need to be modified to use the parameters of the ellipse.
\startformula
	L = m\sqrt{GMr_0}
	\qquad
	H = -G\frac{mM}{2a}
	  = -G\frac{mM}{r\sub{min} + r\sub{max}}
\stopformula
Total energy $H$ is determined by the ellipse's major axis $2a=r\sub{min} + r\sub{max}$. The angular momentum $L$ is determined by Kepler's $r_0$, the distance perpendicular to the ellipse's major axis in \in{figure}[fig:KeplerDistanceEllipse].


\section{Harmonies of the World}

Having mastered the geometry of orbits, Kepler next attempted to unite the quadrivium by finding musical relationships to explain the sizes and eccentricities of the planets' orbits. In 1621 he published his findings as \booktitle{Harmonies of the World,} a book with an amazing mixture of precise astronomical observations and calculations aligned with musical notation for chords and short musical phrases.

It must be admitted that in the early seventeenth century explaining astronomy with music was no more fanciful than introducing ellipses. However, ellipses have survived rigorous observations while the musical speculations have not. The book does contain one remarkable gem, which has come to be known as Kepler's third law. In studying the periods and sizes of the planets' orbits.
\startblockquote
I first believed I was dreaming... But it is absolutely certain and exact that the ratio which exists between the period times of any two planets is precisely the ratio of the \threehalves th power of the mean distance.\autocite{p.~180.}{Kepler1619}
\stopblockquote
This ratio can be used to relate the periods and radii of any two planets' orbits.
\startformula
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^{\threehalves}
\stopformula
where $T_1$ and $a_1$ are the period and semi-major of one planet's orbit, while $T_2$ and $a_2$ are those of the other.
Kepler believed that the \threehalves th power was a sign of a musical perfect fifth. It is not.

A planet's period can be calculated directly using Kepler's area law to fill the area of an elliptic orbit. The area $A$ of an ellipse is easiest to see in the standard mathematical description.
\startformula
	A = \pi ab
\stopformula
We saw Kepler's area law stated as an area update formula (p.\at[eq:AreaUpdate]).
\startformula
	dA = \frac{L}{2m}\,dt
\stopformula
Since the all of the dA are the same size, this total area $A$ covered during the orbit's period $T$ is
\startformula
	A = \frac{L}{2m}\,T
\stopformula
Using the area of an ellipse, the formula for the planet's angular momentum, and the relation $b=\sqrt{ar_0}$, we can calculate the period $T$
\startformula\startmathalignment
\NC	\pi ab           \NC= \frac{L}{2m}\,T \NR
\NC	\pi a\sqrt{a\cancel{r_0}} \NC= \frac{\cancel{m}\sqrt{GM\cancel{r_0}}}{2\cancel{m}}\,T \NR
%\NC	2\pi a^{\threehalves}	\NC = \sqrt{GM}\,T \NR
\NC	T \NC = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{GM}}\,a^{\threehalves}	\NR
\stopmathalignment\stopformula

A planet's orbital period is proportional to the orbit's semi-major axis $a$ raised to the three-halves power.

When Newton presented his laws of motion and gravity in the \booktitle{Principia,} almost eighty years after \booktitle{New Astronomy}, his first application of those laws is a proof of Kepler's area law. Newton goes on to show that elliptic orbits arise only from a force that is inversely proportional to the squared distance. Finally, Newton showed that the \threehalves\ power ratio between period and radius is also a consequence of his theories of motion and gravity. 

Finally, Newton showed that even a tiny change in the gravitational force formula causes the elliptic orbit's long axis to rotate slowly, so that over time the planet traces a flower pattern rather than a simple ellipse.
Many planets' orbits do rotate slowly due to the slight pull of other planets. By 1859 it became clear that only Mercury's orbit rotates in a way that cannot be caused by other planets. This anomaly was not explained until 1915, when Albert Einstein was developing his own geometric model of gravity. For eight years, Einstein had been struggling to build his theory of curved space-time. In the final month, he discovered that his emerging theory predicts a slightly different path for planets close to the Sun. Einstein computed the effect on Mercury's orbit and found it exactly matched the well know anomaly in Mercury's orbit. He recalls, \quotation{for a few days, I was beside myself with joyous excitement.}
Two weeks later he completed the theory of General Relativity.

Kepler's model survived for over three-hundred years – from before Galileo's \booktitle{Starry Messenger} until Einstein's greatest achievement in the twentieth century.
