Consider two cannon balls resting harmlessly on the ground and two others fired directly towards each other at great speed (\in{figure}[fig:restingballs] and \in{}[fig:firedballs]). Descartes and Newton would agree that the resting cannon balls have no quantity of motion (\in{table}[T:restingballs]). They would disagree about the moving cannon balls (\in{table}[T:firedballs]). Descartes's quantity of motion is positive for each moving cannon ball. Therefore, according to Descartes, the total quantity of motion for the moving cannon balls is large. Newton, however, taught us to consider the direction of the motion. 
Both moving cannon balls have momentum, but one's momentum is positive while the other's momentum is negative. The total momentum is \emph{zero} -- exactly the same as the total momentum of the two motionless cannon balls.

Clearly, the moving cannon balls have \emph{something} which the resting cannon balls lack. 
Descartes's quantity of motion is a reasonable guess, but Descartes's quantity of motion failed in collision experiments, as we have already mentioned.
Newton's momentum gives correct predictions for collisions, but momentum fails to distinguish between the large motion of the moving cannon balls and the lack of motion in the resting cannon balls.

Like Newton, Leibniz sought inspiration in the laws of collision demonstrated to the Royal Society in 1668. He was especially impressed by Huygens.
\startblockquote
%	Huygens, the first that I know who has adorned our age with splendid discoveries, seems to me in this argument also to have reached the pure and unadulterated truth and to have freed this doctrine from paralogisms, by certain rules formerly published. Wren also, Wallis and Mariotte, men excellent in these studies though diverse in method, demonstrated nearly these same rules.[New Understanding p. 676]
	Huygens, who illuminated our age with his excellent discoveries, seems to be the first person I know of to have arrived at the pure and clear truth on this matter.... %, and the first to have freed this subject from paralogisms through certain laws he once published.
	Wren, Wallis, and Mariotte, gentlemen excellent in these studies, though, granted, in different ways, all obtained virtually the same rules.\autocite{123}{Leibniz1695}%\footnote{\cite[righttext={ p.\nbsp 123}][Leibniz1695]}
\stopblockquote
Contrary to Newton, Leibniz adopted Huygen's conserved quantity $mv^2$ as the replacement for Descartes's quantity of motion, $m\abs{v}$. Huygens's $mv^2$ is positive for any motion in any direction.
Two cannon balls sitting in the field will have a total $mv^2$ equal to zero, as all agree they must  (\in{table}[T:restingballs]). 
The two cannon balls fired straight at each other will have tremendous total $mv^2$, as Leibniz thought they must due to their motion (\in{table}[T:firedballs]).

Leibniz viewed $mv^2$ as the true measure of motion and called it the \visviva, or \quote{living force.} He elevated conservation of \visviva\ to the level of a universal law, claiming that it was conserved not only in elastic collisions, as Huygens had shown, but in all interactions.
Leibniz first proposed the universal conservation law for $mv^2$ in 1686, the year before Newton published \booktitle{Principia}. Leibniz made \visviva\ one of the cornerstones of his comprehensive philosophy of the world, encompassing physics, ethics, and even theology.

%Following the publication of Newton's \booktitle{Principia}, 
Leibniz accepted  momentum as a conserved measure of motion and attempted to address the confusion among the Cartesians who mistakenly conflated Descartes's quantity of motion and Newton's momentum (described at the end of \in{Chapter}[ch:Momentum]). %Since the term \quote{momentum} had not appeared, Leibniz referred to Newton's momentum as the quantity of progress, distinguishing it from Descartes's quantity of motion.
%His essay, published in the journal \booktitle{Acta Eruditorum}, opened with a title unlikely to win friends amoung the Cartesians: \quote{Brief Demonstration of a Notable Error of Descartes and Others Concerning a Natural Law, According to which God is Said Always to Conserve the Same Quantity of Motion; A Law Which They Also Misuse in Mechanics.}
Notice how Leibniz treats momentum as a directional quantity,  positive for motion in one direction and negative for motion in the other, just as we have done.
\startblockquote
I remark also another conservation, namely, that of the momentum, but neither is this the conservation of that which is absolute.
I call momentum the quantity of motion with which a body proceeds in a certain direction, so that if the body went in a contrary direction, this momentum would be a negative quantity.
Now if two or more bodies\dots
% are concurrent, we take the momentum from the direction whence proceeds their common centre of gravity, and if all these bodies 
proceed from the same direction, then we must take the sum of the momentum of each for the total momentum; and it is plain that in this case the total momentum and the total quantity of motion of the bodies are the same thing. But if one of the bodies proceeded from a contrary direction, its momentum in the direction in question would be negative and consequently must be subtracted from the others in order to have the total momentum.
Thus if there are only two bodies, one of which proceeds in [a] direction\dots% of the common centre, 
and the other in a contrary direction, from the quantity of motion of the first must be subtracted that of the second, and the remainder will be the total momentum. Now it will be found that the total momentum is conserved, or that there is as much momentum in the same direction before or after the impact. But it is also plain that this conservation does not correspond to that which is demanded of something absolute. For it may happen that the velocity, quantity of motion, and \visviva\ being very considerable, their momentum is null. This occurs when the two opposed bodies have their quantities of motion equal. In such case, according to the sense we have just given, there is no total momentum at all.\autocite{658. \quote{Quantity of progress} and \quote{progress} changed to \quote{momentum.} \quote{Force} changed to \textit{\quote{vis viva.}}}{Leibniz1691}
\stopblockquote

Leibniz did not suggest that momentum should be abandoned, but that the \visviva\ should also be considered. Let us look at the specific collision that Newton used as an example in his explanation of the conservation of momentum, shown in \in{figure}[fig:NewtonsExampleElasticVV]. In that one dimensional collision an object $A$ with a mass of $3$ and a velocity of $2$ was overtaken by a smaller object $B$ with a mass of $1$ and a speed of $10$. Newton found the total initial momentum was $6+10=16$. The total momentum was conserved in the collision, but Newton explained that this conservation could be achieved many different ways depending on how much momentum was transferred from ball $B$ to ball $A$ in the collision. Transferring $5$ of momentum would produce a final momentum of $15+1=16$. Transferring $8$ of momentum would produce a final momentum of $18-2=16$. Both of these outcomes, and many others, obey the law of conservation of momentum.

Perhaps Leibniz's \visviva\ can help us make a more specific prediction for this collision. First, we should calculate the initial \visviva\ in Newton's collision. We are actually going to do something that is logically equivalent. We will calculate the closely related kinetic energy.

\section{Kinetic energy}

Modern calculations do not use \visviva, but instead use \keyterm{kinetic energy}, which is half of the \visviva. The symbol for kinetic energy is $K$. 
%Leibniz's \visviva\ is correct, but many calculations will be easier if we use the \keyterm{kinetic energy}, represented by the symbol $K$, which is half of the \visviva.
%\highlightbox{%
\startformula[eq:1DK]
	K = \half mv^2
\stopformula
%}
The factor of one-half is of no consequence for Leibniz. If his \visviva\ quantifies the \quote{absolute} motion of the system, then one-half of the \visviva\ will work just as well. Since we will use kinetic energy later, it is best to get in the habit of including the factor of one-half.

Returning to Newton's collision example, the kinetic energy of ball $A$ would be

\stopformula
for a total initial kinetic energy of $K\si=56$. The initial values of momentum, and kinetic energy for this collision are recorded in \in{table}[T:NewtonCollisionBefore].

Let us make a similar table showing the values after the collision. We are going to consider both of the outcomes mentioned above. First, we consider the case with the larger momentum transfer, where ball $A$'s final momentum is $18$ and ball $B$'s is $-2$. Ball $A$'s final velocity is found from its momentum.

A similar calculation gives Ball $B$'s kinetic energy. Confirm the values in \in{table}[T:NewtonCollisionAfter4], which show that \emph{both} the momentum and the kinetic energy are conserved in this case. When ball $B$ transferred $8$ of momentum to ball $A$, it also transferred $48$ of kinetic energy, keeping both totals the same.

If the collision has a really good bounce, the kinetic energy after the collision will be the same as the kinetic energy before, and the collision is called \keyterm{elastic}.
Leibniz describes what happens during an elastic collision.

	If bodies A and B collide as in figure \in[fig:LeibnizCollision], and come from $\mathrm{A}_1$, and $\mathrm{B}_1$, to the place $\mathrm{A}_2$, $\mathrm{B}_2$, where they collide, they will, little by little, be compressed there, just like two inflated balls, and approach one another more and more, continually increasing the internal pressure. By that very circumstance the motion itself is weakened, the \visviva\ having been
transformed into their elasticity, until they are altogether at rest. Then, finally, restoring themselves through their elasticity, they rebound from one another; having started a retrograde motion from rest, a motion that continually increases, in the end they move
apart, having regained the same speed with which they originally approached one another, but directed oppositely, and they return to $\mathrm{A}_3$, and $\mathrm{B}_3$, which coincide with the places $\mathrm{A}_1$, and $\mathrm{B}_1$, if the bodies are assumed to be of the same size and the same velocity.\autocite{132. \quote{Figure 7} changed to figure \in[fig:LeibnizCollision]. \quote{Force} changed to \textit{\quote{vis viva.}}}{Leibniz1695}%

%	[New Understanding p. 686]
\stopblockquote
In Leibniz's example, the speeds are the same after the collision as before, so the total kinetic energy also remains the same. In many elastic collisions each object does not retain the same velocity; one speeds up and one slows down as in Newton's example. However, Huygens demonstrated the total $mv^2$ remains the same in all perfectly elastic collisions. Therefore, the total kinetic energy also remains the same.

%The conservation of \visviva\ ran into experimental conflicts immediately, much like Descartes's quantity of motion. Like Descartes, Leibniz defended  his theory, arguing that \visviva\ was conserved even in experiment where it apparently was lost. Leibniz's defense did not invoke the unseen forces and substances of Descartes, but instead sought an explanation within the objects themselves.

However, most collisions are \emph{not} perfectly elastic. Some collisions are nearly elastic, like a collision between steel balls. Others are perfectly inelastic, like a collision between balls of clay that stick together. Inelastic collisions always loose some \visviva. Leibniz addresses this challenge.

\startblockquote
	%But it is necessary to admit, that although bodies must be thus naturally elastic in the sense which I have just explained, nevertheless 
	The elasticity often appears insufficient in the masses or bodies which we employ....
	%, even if these masses should be composed of elastic parts and should resemble a sack full of hard balls which would yield to a moderate impact, without leaving the sack, as we see in the case of soft bodies or those which yield without recovering themselves sufficiently. 
	The reason is that the parts are not sufficiently united therein to transfer their change to the whole. Whence it comes that in the impact of such bodies a part of the \visviva\ is absorbed by the small parts which compose the mass....%, without this force being given to the whole; and this must always happen when the pressed mass does not recover perfectly; although it also happens that a mass shows itself more or less elastic according to the different manner of the impact, witness the water itself which yields to a moderate impression, and makes a cannon-ball rebound.[New Understanding p. 669]
	Now when the parts of the bodies absorb the \visviva\ of the impact, as a whole, as when two pieces of rich earth or of clay come into collision, or in part, as when two wooden balls meet, which are much less elastic than two globes of jasper or tempered steel...%; when, I say, some \visviva\ is absorbed by the parts, it is as good as lost for the absolute force, and for the respective velocity, that is to say, for the third and the first equation, which do not succeed, since 
	that which remains after the impact has become less than what it was before the impact, by reason of a part of the \visviva\ being turned else where.\autocite{669--670}{Leibniz1691}
\stopblockquote

Leibniz explanation is mostly correct. When the balls collide some of the balls' \visviva\ is transferred to the atoms and molecules within each ball. These microscopic parts jiggle constantly, and their random motion caries considerable \visviva. The collision increases this microscopic random motion, increasing the internal \visviva.


Since some of the \visviva\ is transferred to microscopic motion, the visible \visviva\ will 
%be evidently conserved in elastic collisions, but will 
appear to decrease in inelastic collisions.
\startblockquote
	%But the momentum...%, or rather the second equation, is not concerned therein. And even the motion of this total progress 
	%remains... %alone
%	When the two bodies proceed together after the impact with the velocity of their common centre, as do two balls of rich earth or clay. But in the semi-elastics, as two wooden balls, it happens still further that the bodies mutually depart after the impact, although with a weakening of the first equation, following this force of the impact which has not been absorbed. And in consequence of certain experiments touching the degree of the elasticity of this wood, we might predict what should happen to the balls which should be made of it in every kind of collision or impact.

	But this loss of the total \visviva...%, or this failure of the third equation, 
	does not detract from the inviolable truth of the law of the conservation of the same \visviva\ in the world. For that which is absorbed by the minute parts is not absolutely lost for the universe....%, although it is lost for the total \visviva\ of the concurrent bodies.

While microscopic random motion can hide a large amount of \visviva, this motion cannot hide any momentum. %The microscopic motion is random and disorganized.
The random motion, because it is random, occurs equally in all directions, so its total momentum is zero.
%The total momentum of the parts is not exactly zero. 
The total momentum -- due only to the atoms shared, nonrandom motion -- is visible in the ball's motion. Since no momentum can be hidden in the microscopic parts \quote{the total momentum...remains,} even in inelastic collisions.\autocite{670. \quote{Progress} replaced by \quote{momentum.}}{Leibniz1691}

The effects of the inelastic bounce can be seen by looking again at Newton's example. In the case where ball $B$ only transfers $4$ of momentum to ball $A$, both balls are a little more sluggish after the collision due to the loss of kinetic energy, as shown in figures~\in[fig:NewtonsExampleInelastic] and \in[fig:PendulumCollisionGraph3]. This loss can calculated by using the balls' final momentums to find their velocities and then their kinetic energies. The intermediate step of finding the velocity is going to get tedious quickly, so it is worth finding the direct relationship between kinetic energy and momentum.
%To get the greatest benefit from these two ideas it is helpful to relate momentum and kinetic energy directly.
This is accomplished by replacing the velocity with momentum in the kinetic energy formula. Since $v= p/m$, this gives
\startformula\startmathalignment 
	\NC K	\NC = \half mv^2	\NR
	\NC		\NC = \half m \left(\frac{p}{m}\right)^2. %= \frac{p^2}{2m}

%Momentum requires energy\index{energy}.
Because momentum and kinetic energy are central concepts in mechanics, this relation between them is extremely useful. There are a couple of things to notice about this formula.
First, momentum and kinetic energy are closely related. If an object is not moving, then its momentum and kinetic energy are both zero. If it is moving, then neither is zero.
Second, momentum is directional, but kinetic energy is not. The sign of the momentum tells which direction the momentum is pointing. The kinetic energy is always positive, independent of the direction.
A object moving in the positive direction with a momentum of $10\units{kg\.m/s}$ has the same kinetic energy as a cart moving the negative direction with a momentum of $-10\units{kg\.m/s}$.

Confirm the remaining kinetic energies in \in{table}[T:NewtonCollisionAfter1]. After the inelastic collision the total kinetic energy is only 38, less than the 56 that the balls had before the collision. Some of the energy has been \quotation{absorbed by the small parts which compose the mass} according to Leibniz. However, notice that none of the momentum is lost. In an inelastic collision less momentum is transferred, but the total momentum stays the same. Inelastic collisions lose kinetic energy, but not momentum!

In most problems you will need to include units in your calculations. The units of kinetic energy are somewhat cumbersome, so a convenient energy unit, the joule, has been adopted to clean up the mess. The symbol for a joule is J (not to be confused with the symbol for impulse, $J$). % and it is related to the other standard SI units by the definition

%\section{The vis viva debate}
Leibniz recognized truth of Newton's momentum formula, even if he preferred his \visviva\ as an absolute measure of motion. His criticism of Descartes's quantity of motion provoked a forceful defense from the Cartesians, who mistakenly pointed to Newton's successful momentum as vindication. Over the next decade the \visviva\ debate became entangled with a bitter priority dispute between Newton and Leibniz over who had discovered calculus. Newton's followers frequently viewed these debates as a question of loyalty rather than science.

Some scientists did not take sides purely out of loyalty, but instead approached the question with rigorous calculations and careful experiments, as scientists should. The famous Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli was persuaded to switch camps by Leibniz's mathematical arguments. Bernoulli became a dedicated and vocal advocate for Leibniz and \visviva.

\placefigure[margin][fig:GravesandeDrop]
	{’s Gravesande dropped spheres into soft clay from various heights to measure their \visviva. This digram appears in his 1740 textbook.\autocite{plate 32}{Gravesande1747}}
	{\externalfigure[chapter04/GravesandeDrop][width=144pt]}
\placefigure[margin][fig:GravesandeDropSpheres]
	{’s Gravesande used three spheres with the same radius for the above experiment. Two of them were hollow inside so that they had less mass than the solid one. Their masses were in the ratio 3:2:1.\autocite{plate 32}{Gravesande1747}}
	{\externalfigure[chapter04/GravesandeDropSpheres][width=144pt]}

The Dutch scientist Willem ’s Gravesande designed experiments to compare impacts of different objects traveling at different speeds. %]
He did this first by dropping balls into clay. He worked with a set of balls identical in size but different in mass, shown in figures \in[fig:GravesandeDrop] and \in[fig:GravesandeDropSpheres]. When any of these balls was dropped onto the clay it would land with an inelastic thud.
’s Gravesande measured the size of the dent left in the clay to determine the impact's effect. If a light, fast ball left the same size dent as a heavy, slow ball, then the two balls had produced the same effect. He thought the effect would be determined by the ball's momentum $mv$, so that if the heavy ball's mass is double the light ball's mass, then the light ball's velocity would have to be double the heavy ball's velocity to make the same size dent. If the heavy ball was four times the mass of the light ball, then the light ball would need to be traveling four times as fast to produce the same effect.

When ’s Gravesande performed this experiment, the results surprised him. His experiments showed that if the heavy ball's mass was four times the lighter ball's mass, then the lighter ball would need to move only twice as fast to produce the same dent. This is  predicted by Leibniz's formula $mv^2$. After confirming this for many different ratios of mass, ’s Gravesande concluded that he had been mistaken. He adopted \visviva\ as a measure of motion, and enthusiastically shared the discovery. His contribution arrived as the \visviva\ debate was at its peak.

%In the seventeenth century there was no way to test Leibniz's claim that the \visviva\ lost by the colliding balls was taken up by the motion of tiny internal parts. 
%Scientists in the early eighteenth century were doing many experiments on motion, and confronting the same confusing results as my students. The experiments that supported Newton's formula were fairly well understood, but many experiments supported Leibniz's formula. With experiments giving apparently contradictory results, confusion reigned.%
\startblockquote
	The 1720s saw the height of the argument in the English, French, and Dutch learned journals. In 1722, two articles in the \booktitle{Journal litt\'eraire} described Willem ’s Gravesande's version of an experiment with copper and ceramic balls---bodies of different masses---falling into a clay-filled tray. He compared the depression they made as a way of quantifying the \quote{force} of one body colliding with another and confirming Leibniz's concept.\autocite{185}{Zinsser2006}
\stopblockquote

While ’s Gravesande's evidence won a few converts, many scientists remained loyal the Cartesian quantity of motion, largely out of devotion to Newton. In 1728, French scientist Dortous de Mairan made a case for the Cartesian formula in his discourses on the \quote{Estimation and the Measure of Motor Forces of Bodies.} His forceful argument convinced most scientists on the continent that \visviva\ was a failed idea.

\section{Work}
Engineers, on the other hand, were not reading academic papers about \visviva, they were building increasingly powerful and complex machines – water wheels, windmills, pumps – to perform important, difficult tasks like grinding grain and lifting water out of mines. The sought to quantify the usefulness of these machines not as a scientific investigation, but in order to answer economic questions. If a small team or horses could run a mill grinding grain, could a windmill  or a water wheel achieve the same result at a lower cost? If a water wheel in town could grind a certain amount of grain, how much water could be pumped out of a mine in the hills using a similar water wheel there? The quantity that answers these questions is the \keyterm{work}. 

I am sure you have done quite a bit of physical work and have some sense of what physical work is. Pushing a refrigerator down a long hallway requires a lot of work. It takes a lot of force to move the refrigerator at all, and  the force must be maintained over a long displacement. The amount of work is simply the product of the force and the displacement.
\startformula
	W = F\Delta x
\stopformula
The argument for the work formula is straight forward. Sliding the refrigerator two meters requires twice as much work as sliding it one meter, because first you slide it one meter, and then you slide it one meter again, doing the same amount of work twice. Therefore, the work is proportional to the distance.
Sliding two refrigerators one meter requires twice as much work as sliding a single refrigerator one meter. If you slide the refrigerators one at a time, the work is twice as much because you do the work of sliding one refrigerator twice. If you push them one meter at the \emph{same} time, then you must push with twice as much force. Pushing with this double force accomplishes double the work in only one meter. Therefore, the work is proportional to the force. We conclude, $W = F\Delta x$. This argument was made many times during the \visviva\ debate, although I am not sure who argued it first.
%During the \visviva\ debate, this was called effort, or the effect of the \visviva. We will use the current term: work.

What if you decide to push the refrigerator in the negative direction? To make the refrigerator move in the negative direction you will have to apply a negative force. This will cause a negative displacement. Since the force and the displacement are both negative, the work will be positive. No matter which way you push the refrigerator, you will need to do positive work!

While you are pushing the refrigerator in the positive direction, friction with the floor is opposing the motion by pushing in the negative direction. While the force exerted by the friction is negative, the displacement is still positive, so the work done by friction is negative. The refrigerator gets some kinetic energy due to the positive work that you do pushing it, but that kinetic energy is quickly lost due to the negative work done by friction.

The work done by the block is found using the work formula, but take care to use the correct force between the block and the track. The work done by the block is calculated using the force \emph{of} the block, but we are given the force \emph{on} the block. Newton's third law tells us that the force of the block on the track is equal and opposite to the force of the track on the block. Therefore, we will calculate the work using $F=0.30\units{N}$ for the force of the block on the track.

’s Gravesande's experiment provides a good example of positive and negative work being done in the $y$-direction. A dropped ball is pulled downward by the gravitational force. The downward force is negative, and the downward displacement is also negative, so work done by the gravitational force is positive, increasing the ball's kinetic energy.

When the ball hits the clay, the clay exerts an upwards force much greater than the gravitational force. The ball continues down a bit, making a dent in the clay, so there is a small negative displacement even as the clay is exerting a large positive force. The work done by the clay is the product of the positive force and the negative displacement, so it is negative. The negative work done by the clay eliminates the ball's kinetic energy, brining it to a stop.

%The size of the dent in the clay was proportional to the work done by the ball during the impact. Dents are harder to measure than displacements, but the idea is the same. His data showed that the work done was proportional to the \visviva, not the momentum.


%Leibniz's did not know that the balls' temperature is a measure of the microscopic random motion – higher temperature indicating greater microscopic \visviva. The loss of the balls' \visviva\ to the microscopic parts causes an increase in temperature, but the increase is extremely small, far too small for seventeenth century experimenters to measure. The idea that the temperature is connected to microscopic \visviva\ appeared several times in the decades that followed, but was not widely accepted until the middle of the nineteenth century. We will return to this idea in Volume II.

%To conclude this chapter, we will apply the conservation laws to three experiments,euoa the cart pushing the sliding block using wo


\section{Conservation of energy}

Leibniz explained inelastic collisions by suggesting that some of the \visviva\ was transferred to the microscopic parts. However, very little was known about those microscopic parts, so this suggestion was largely a guess. Luckily, Leibniz was mostly correct. The \visviva\ does get transferred to the parts, but some of it also gets transformed into something else. To explain this, I will switch to the modern vocabulary. The kinetic energy of colliding objects does get transferred to the microscopic parts, but some of the kinetic energy becomes other kinds of energy. I am not going to list the other types of energy now, but they will start appearing soon. Here it is sufficient to know that there are other types of energy and only the total energy is conserved. The symbol for total energy is $H$.%, honoring William Rowan Hamilton, who we will meet in \in{Chapter}[ch:1Ddynamics].

The conservation law for total energy $H$ looks very similar to the conservation law for momentum.
%\highlightbox{
\startformula[eq:1DEconserve]
	H\si + W + Q = H\sf %\sub{net} + Q\sub{net}
\stopformula
%}%\end{shaded}
Energy can be added or removed from a system through work $W$ done by outside forces. 
A person pushing a cart does positive work, increasing the cart's kinetic energy. Friction resists the cart's motion, doing negative work and decreasing the cart's kinetic energy.

Energy can also be added as heat $Q$ by cooking the cart over a fire, which increases the random, microscopic energy of the cart's atoms and molecules. We will not study heat until Volume II. Until then we will faithfully include $Q$ when writing the conservation of energy equation, but immediately cross it out because the heat transfer $Q$ is zero in mechanics problems. In mechanics, any change in a system's total energy is due to an outside force doing work on the system.

{The block's energy as a function of position for \in{example}[ex:BlockSlideK].}
{\noindent\typesetbuffer[TikZ:BlockSlideK]} % figure contents

\noindent
The plot in \in{figure}[fig:BlockSlideK] shows the energy of the block as a function of position while the block is slowing to a stop. The block starts out with $1.72\units{J}$ of energy, and loses that energy as it slides to the right. Because the negative work done by friction is proportional to the distance, the energy decreases in proportion to the distance. The slope is equal to the force, $-0.20\units{N}$.

	%At first it looks like this formula is giving a negative kinetic energy, but kinetic energy is \emph{never} negative! The force $F$ and the displacement $\Delta x$ are both directional, so they can be either positive or negative. In this problem the displacement is positive and the force is negative. Plugging in a positive displacement and a negative force would give a positive kinetic energy, just as it should.
%\end{solution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%For the cart pushing the block, we found the work done \emph{by} the system. The conservation of energy equation includes the work done \emph{on} the system. When calculating the work $W$ done \emph{on} the system, use the force $F$ \emph{on} the system.
%\startformula
%	W = F\Delta x
%\stopformula
%If the cart and block are sliding in the positive direction, then the displacement $\Delta x$ will be positive but the force $F$, which resists the motion, will be negative. Therefore, the work $W$ is going to be negative, decreasing the energy as we would expect.
%
%If the cart and the block were sliding in the negative direction, then the displacement would be negative but the resisting force of friction would be positive, so the work would still be negative, decreasing the energy again.
%The sign of the work does not tell us which way the object is traveling, it only tells of if the energy is increasing or decreasing. Work is not a directional quantity like displacement and force. 
%
%Distinguishing directional from nondirectional quantities can be a bit tricky. A quick and reliable method is to consider what would happen to the quantity if the coordinate system was reversed, as shown if figure\in[fig:reverse].
%The same situation is shown in both of the drawings, except in one the coordinates increase from left to right, and in the other they increase from right to left. Vectors are drawn for displacement and momentum, which are both directed towards the right, and force, which is directed towards the left.
%
%This illustrates an important fact about directional quantities: the product of two directional quantities is \emph{not} directional. We already saw an example of this with kinetic energy, $\half mv^2$. Velocity is directional, but the square of the velocity (product of velocity with itself) is always positive independent of the velocity's direction. Unlike kinetic energy, work can be positive or negative, but the sign does not tell us the direction of the work.

%\subsection{slide} 
%
%To understand the experiments with the sliding block, we need to know something about the impulse and work contributed by an external force. The method of calculating these contributions was central to Du Châtelet's argument. Newton had shown that the contribution to the momentum is the product of the force, $F$, and the force's duration, $\Delta t$. Du Châtelet agreed, but argued that for \visviva\ (kinetic energy) displacement $\Delta x$ matters, not the time. She gave numerous clever examples to demonstrate the importance of distance, including the experiment by ’s Gravesande.
%
%Following Du Châtelet's argument, we have the formula for work.%, the fist involving the duration of the force's action and the second involving the displacement.
%

%Notice how similar this is to the formula for impulse: $J=F\Delta t$.
%
%
%
%
%
%
%\subsection{Collision}
%
%
%In collision experiments, there are no external forces acting on the balls that could change their total momentum or kinetic energy.
%The calculation of the momentum before and after the collision gives the same answer, showing that the momentum is indeed conserved in the collision. The calculations of kinetic energy do not agree. The kinetic energy is always lower after the collision, demonstrating that kinetic energy is not conserved in the collision. This loss of kinetic energy in collisions was one of the strongest arguments against Leibniz's \visviva.
%
%Du Châtelet argued, correctly, that while there are no external forces that can change the kinetic energy, the kinetic energy can be used up within the system. She thought that the energy persisted in another form, and we now know that it does.
%The kinetic energy is actually converted to disorganized form of energy that we will study in chapter \in[ch:thermo]. % very slightly raises the temperature of the carts' bumpers.
%Momentum does not convert to another form, because there is no other form of momentum. All momentum is associated with motion and given by equation (\in[eq:1Dp]).
%
%
%
%
%While kinetic energy is not conserved, overall energy is. The collision experiments can be modified so that the lost energy is stored in a measurable form, for example in the compression of a spring. When this stored energy is included, the total energy before and after the collision agree.
%
%
%Let us return again to our two experiments. We now understand the results of the experiment involving the two carts. Since there were no external forces, momentum and energy were both unchanged, but some of the kinetic energy was changed into another form of energy. We saw the loss in kinetic energy because kinetic energy was the only kind of energy we measured.
%
%
%
%
%
%Reading \booktitle{Foundations of Physics} gave me an idea. When my students performed the experiment with the wood block, I had them record the displacement of the block ($\Delta x$) and the time that the block was sliding ($\Delta t$). My students created two more graphs using their time measurements: one with $mv$ as a function of $\Delta t$ and one with $mv^2$ as a function of $\Delta t$. The $mv$ graph is a nice line, while the $mv^2$ graph is a mess.
%
%% Show the graphs!
%Finally, I had my students find the slopes of the two good graphs: Leibniz's graph $mv^2$ as a function of $\Delta x$, and Newton's graph $mv$ as a function of $\Delta t$. Although the units on the axes of the two graphs are different, the slopes have the same units. Also, the slope of Leibniz's graph is twice the slope of Newton's graph. If we replace $mv^2$ on Leibniz's graph with $K=\half mv^2$, then the two slopes are exactly the same.
%
%
%
%Kinetic energy is not directional. A cart moving in the positive direction has a positive velocity, so its momentum and kinetic energy are both positive. A cart is moving in the negative direction has a negative velocity but the square of the negative velocity is positive, so the kinetic energy is positive. The cart's kinetic energy is never negative, and is only zero when the cart is not moving.

%Momentum, like displacement and velocity, is directional, but 

%The cart and the wood block will never be moving more than a few meters per second, so these approximations are excellent for our current purposes.

%In fact, eighteenth century physicists were studying on thing that moves at high enough speed to violate equation (\in[eq:1DpK]): light itself. Light has no mass ($m=0$) so equations (\in[eq:1DpK]) tell us that light has no momentum and no kinetic energy. However, the kinetic energy of sun light is actually the greatest source of energy on Earth. Nearly all energy on Earth, from plants and fossil fuels to wind and solar power, can be traced back to energy that was delivered to us from the sun as the kinetic energy of light.
%
%Careful measurements of light show that it also has momentum, but the momentum is tiny. All of the sunlight hitting Earth delivers about as much momentum as we would get from a squirt-gun.

\section{A momentum and energy puzzle}

With the \visviva\ debate settled, physicists began using momentum and kinetic energy to understand all manner of physical interactions.
A nice example of how momentum and kinetic energy work together, considered by Rene Descartes, is a ball bouncing off of a wall, as in figure \in[fig:ballwall].
We know that the ball's speed coming off of the wall will be close the speed it had before hitting the wall, but it would be nice to know why it is the same using either conservation of momentum or energy. 

Perhaps we can use conservation of momentum to show that the speed does not change. (This is a one dimensional problem, so $p$ and $J$ are directional.)
\startformula
	p\si + J = p\sf
\stopformula
Two problems arise immediately. First, we cannot discard impulse from the wall, $J=F\Delta t$. The ball and the wall are only in contact for a short time $\Delta t$, but the force $F$ exerted by the wall during that time is huge. If you have ever had a ball bounced off of your head (or bounced your head off of a wall), you know that this force delivers some impulse!

The second problem is that the initial momentum and final momentum are not close to each other \emph{at all}. The magnitudes are similar, but the initial and final momenta are in opposite directions, making the change in momentum  quite large. This is due, of course, to the huge impulse delivered by the wall. Conservation of momentum  gives us no idea why the \emph{magnitude} of the momentum is largely unchanged by the collision.

Descartes and the Cartesians avoided this problem by using mass times  \emph{speed} as the conserved quantity. While this trick works for the bouncing ball, it fails in almost every other situation, as Wren demonstrated. Velocity and momentum are directional. Ignoring the direction of directional quantities produces nonsense.

While Descartes's proposal was a failure, his instinct was correct. The problem needs to be investigated in a way that ignores the direction. The correct way to do that is to look at a nondirectional quantity, as emphasized by Leibniz and Du Châtelet. In this case the correct nondirectional quantity is energy, as shown in figure \in[fig:ballwallK]
%For a bounce using conservation of energy.

\stopmathalignment \stopformula
In a good bounce very little of the kinetic energy is changed into other forms of energy, so we can ignore other types of energy and replace energy with kinetic energy in the second line above. The work in this case is the work done by the wall on the ball. As we already noted, the force is large. However,  the wall does not move, so $\Delta x$ is zero and no work is done by the wall. If the wall were moving, it could do significant work during the short time it is in contact with the ball. Watch out when bouncing balls off of moving objects!

With no work being done, the final kinetic energy is the same as the initial kinetic energy.

	\NC \frac{p\si^2}{2m}	\NC = \frac{p\sf^2}{2m}	\NR
	\NC p\si^2 		\NC = p\sf^2	\NR

\stopmathalignment \stopformula
Recall from your algebra class that you must include a plus-or-minus when you take the square root of both sides of an equation, as in the last line above, because opposites have the same square. In physics class you will often know from the problem whether you should use the plus sign or the minus sign. In this case that the final momentum is in the opposite direction and therefore must have the opposite sign.
\startformula
	p\si = -p\sf
\stopformula
Conservation of energy shows us that the \emph{magnitude} of the momentum is unchanged. From this it is obvious that the speed is unchanged as well, and Descartes's problem is solved (thirty-six years after his death, unfortunately).

In real collisions some or all of the kinetic energy is turned into other types of energy. The ball bouncing off the wall loses some kinetic energy, so the magnitude of the final momentum will be less than the magnitude of the initial momentum. This does not mean that some of the momentum has been lost, just that the impulse delivered by the wall is not quite as huge as it was for the perfectly bouncing ball.

\section{Kinetic energy and work in three dimensions}

Energy is not directional, so all types of energy are represented by scalars, not by vectors. Kinetic energy depends on an object's speed, but not its direction. When working in two or three dimensions, $v$, is the speed.
\startformula
v = \sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2},
\stopformula
Putting this speed into the kinetic formula gives the kinetic energy formula in three dimensions.
\startformula
	K= \half mv^2 = \half m\left(v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2\right)
\stopformula
Momentum plays such a central role in motion that it is usually better to work with momentum rather than velocity whenever possible.
\startformula
	K = \frac{p^2}{2m} = \frac{p_x^2+p_y^2+p_z^2}{2m}
\stopformula
Since each component of the momentum contributes to the kinetic energy, it is often useful to consider these contributions individually.
\startformula
	K = K_x + K_y + K_z,
\stopformula	
where the individual contributions are
\startformula\
	K_x = \half mv_x^2 = \frac{p_x^2}{2m},\qquad
	K_y = \half mv_y^2 = \frac{p_y^2}{2m},\qquad
	K_z = \half mv_z^2 = \frac{p_z^2}{2m}.	
\stopformula
Each contribution to the kinetic energy represents the energy required to give the object momentum in the corresponding direction. $K_x$ is the energy required to give the object momentum $p_x$ in the $x$-direction, while $K_y$ is the additional energy required to give the object momentum $p_y$ in the $y$-direction, and likewise for $K_z$.

The contributions to the kinetic energy are \emph{not} components of a kinetic energy vector. It is useful to divide up the kinetic energy into three contributions, but I fear that you may be tempted to treat these as components of a vector. Do not do it! You will never have reason to write the vector $\vec K = \components{K_x,K_y,K_z}$, because kinetic energy is not a vector. Instead write $K= K_x + K_y + K_z$ to get a number. For a vector, like momentum, you would never add the components, $p=p_x+p_y+p_z$, because the result is a number, not the vector. Instead write $\vec{p}=\components{p_x,p_y,p_z}$.

The work formula in three dimensions is also a total of the work in each direction.
\startformula
	W = F_x\Delta x + F_y\Delta y + F_z\Delta z
\stopformula
We have already discussed how force in the same direction as the displacement does positive work, while force opposite the displacement does negative work. The work formula in three dimensions shows that force perpendicular to the displacement does no work at all, neither positive nor negative.

If I push on the back of a rolling cart I do positive work, increasing its kinetic energy. If I push backwards on the front of a rolling cart I do negative work, decreasing its kinetic energy. If I push on the side of a rolling cart, so that I neither speed it up nor slow it down, then I do no work on the cart.

\startexample
You are pushing a refrigerator with a force of $\components{25,10}\unit{N}$. Your friend is also pushing, but in another direction.  When you both finish pushing, the refrigerator’s displacement is $\Delta x=5.0\units{m}$ and $\Delta y=-3.0\units{m}$.  What is the work that you do on the refrigerator?

\startsolution
We don’t need your friend’s force to find the work you do. Your force is enough.
\startformula\startmathalignment
\NC	W \NC= F_x\Delta x + F_y\Delta y \NR
\NC		\NC= (25\units{N})(5.0\units{m}) + (10\units{N})(-3.0\units{m}) \NR
\NC		\NC= \left(125 - 30 \right)\units{N\.m} \NR
\NC		\NC= \answer{95\units{J}}
\stopmathalignment\stopformula
You do $95\units{J}$ of work on the refrigerator. There is no way to know from this information if your friend is working at all.

\section{Angular motion and rotational kinetic energy}

The final resolution to the \visviva\ debate came from an unexpected source -- the extremely clever French noblewoman Emilie Du Châtelet. %, who investigated both sides of the debate in great depth.
Emilie was born in 1706. Her wealthy father used his connections in the court of King Louis XIV to arrange Emilie's marriage to a high ranking military officer with a distinguished noble linage. The couple did not know each other before their wedding, but they knew the benefits of their union. At the age of eighteen, she became a noblewoman, Madame la marquise Du Châtelet. Her husband, twelve years older, gained financial resources and connections to advance his military carer. Shortly after the birth of their third child in 1733, Emilie Du Châtelet took an interest in mathematics and geometry, reading many books and hiring an excellent tutor. She met the famous playwright Voltaire that same year and began collaborating with him intimately on many projects, including the study of Newtonian Physics.

In 1738, at the age of thirty, Du Châtelet wrote a physics book, \booktitle{Institutions de Physique} or \booktitle{Foundations of Physics}. She had been unable to find an introductory physics text for her son, so she wrote \booktitle{Foundations} for him. She explained Newtonian mechanics with great clarity and conviction. No reader could doubt her mastery and enthusiasm for Newton's theory of motion.

In the final chapter, Du Châtelet explains \visviva. She reminds her son of \quotation{the memoir that M.~de Mairan gave in 1728 to the Academy against \visviva\ that we read together, and in which the famous proceeding is explained with much clarity and eloquence.} She continues,
\startblockquote
	As this work appears to me to be the most ingenious that has been produced against \visviva, I will pause to take the time to remind you here of some passages, and to refute them.\autocite{188}{DuChatelet1740}
\stopblockquote
Even as she refuted the Cartesian position, her mastery of Newtonian physics was on full display. In many  examples she first used Newtonian physics to predict what would happen. She then showed, based on this Newtonian analysis, that \visviva\ was also conserved, but Descartes' quantity of motion was not.

As her final argument of this type, Du Châtelet calls on the authority of Isaac Newton himself! In the forth and final edition of \booktitle{Opticks}, published in 1730, Newton includes an essay on forces in nature. In it, he argues that the quantity of motion is \emph{not} conserved.
“For from the various Composition of two Motions, ’tis very certain that there is not always the same quantity of Motion in the World.”
He provides an example in which “two Globes joined by a slender Rod, revolve about their common Center of Gravity with an uniform Motion, while that Center moves on uniformly in a right Line\dots,” as shown in figure~\in[fig:spinningmoving]. (The center of gravity is an idea we will return to later in this chapter. We will call it the center of mass.) These combined motions, once they are started, will continue uniformly without any external forces. In this situation,

the Sum of the Motions of the two Globes, as often as the Globes are in the right Line described by their common Center of Gravity, will be bigger than the Sum of their Motions, when they are in a Line perpendicular to that right Line. By this Instance it appears that Motion may be got or lost.
\stopblockquote
Du Châtelet confirms this with specific masses and velocities. She gives a mass $m=1$ to each of the globes, which she calls body A and body B. She sets the rod spinning such that the bodies move with speeds $v=1$ about the center, while that center moves with a speed $v=1$ to the right. She first considers the moment when the rod is perpendicular to the line. At this moment body B’s velocity due to the spinning is in the same direction as the rod’s central motion, so the velocities add to give a velocity with magnitude $v\sub{B} = 2$. Body A’s velocity due to the spinning is exactly opposite the rod’s central velocity, so the velocities add to give a velocity with magnitude $v\sub{A}=0$. The total quantity of motion is then
\startformula
mv\sub{B}+mv\sub{A} = 1\cdot 2 + 1\cdot 0 = 2
\stopformula
She then considers the moment when the rod aligns with the line. At this moment body B’s velocity due to the spinning is upwards, perpendicular to the rod’s central velocity, so the velocities add (using the tip-to-tail method) to give a velocity with magnitude $v\sub{A}=\sqrt 2$. Similarly, body A’s velocity due to the rod’s rotation is downward, giving body A a speed $v\sub{A}=\sqrt 2$. The total quantity of motion is then
\startformula
mv\sub{B}+mv\sub{A} = 1\cdot \sqrt 2 + 1\cdot \sqrt 2 = 2 \sqrt 2
\stopformula
Clearly, the quantity of motion is not constant in this example. However, the total momentum $\vec p = \vec p\sub{B} + \vec p\sub{B}$ is constant, always to the right with a magnitude $p = 2$. What about the \visviva? 
The following example gives us a clue.

%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\startexample[ex:NewtonGlobes]
Find the total kinetic energy of Newton’s connected globes when the connecting rod is perpendicular to the center’s line of motion and when the rod is aligned with the center’s line of motion. Use Du Châtelet’s masses and speeds (with units). Each globe has a mass of $1\units{kg}$. The speeds are $1\units{m/s}$ due to the rotation about the center of mass and $1\units{m/s}$ due to the center of mass’s motion.

\stopformula
The kinetic energy is the same for both orientations, $K=2\units{J}$ in both cases. With some additional work is it possible to show that the energy remains constant for all orientations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Du Châtelet computed the \visviva, which is double the kinetic energy, and reached the same conclusion.
\startblockquote
It is easy to prove that the \visviva\ always remains the same, although the quantity of motion varies.\autocite{188}{DuChatelet1740}
\stopblockquote
You would be wise to wonder if Newton’s example or Du Châtelet’s choice of values are somehow special. Perhaps the symmetry of two masses or the match between the rotational and linear speeds causes the kinetic energy to balance in some way, keeping it constant. In fact, this case is not special.
\startblockquote
In all cases, and especially in that which I have just cited from M. Newton, the \visviva\ stay invariable. \autocite{p.~199}{DuChatelet1740}
\stopblockquote
Any velocities, any masses, and any rigid shape will have a constant kinetic energy unless external forces act on the object to change its energy. If the masses are different or if the shape is asymmetrical then the center of mass is not necessarily in the geometric center, but the object still rotates naturally about its center of mass and kinetic energy is constant. (We will learn more about theses situations near the end of the chapter when we look more closely and rotational motion.) Du Châtelet’s new that these complicated cases worked as well, but the simple example above made her point quite clearly.


While freely moving objects travel along straight lines, interactions cause and abundance of circular motions, from the orbits that dominate the solar system down to the everyday rotations of tops, wheels and even Earth itself. So far, we have studied circular motions using the same tools we use for linear motions, $\vec p = m\vec v$ for momentum and $K = \half mv^2$ for kinetic energy. For orbits $\vec v$ was the instantaneous velocity of the orbiting planet or moon. For the connected globes in Newton’s Query 31, $\vec v$ was the velocity of each globe, found by adding the velocities due to rotation and central motion.

Unfortunately, we are about to run into serious trouble because nearly all rotating objects have parts that are moving with different velocities. Parts near the center of rotation complete small circles while parts far away  complete much larger circles in the same time. Figure ?? shows a typical example – a rolling disk – with many different velocities. Parts near the top are moving faster, while parts near the ground are slower. Parts on the leading side are moving down toward the ground, while parts on the trailing side are moving upward. If you are skilled with vector calculus then you know just what to do, and you can skip the rest of this section. If you don’t have those skills, you will need some tools to handle momentum and energy in common situations like rolling. Specifically, we need a method for finding the total momentum and total kinetic energy of an object that is rotating and possibly moving at the same time.

The trick for momentum is quite simple: ignore the rotation and look only at the momentum of the center. The total momentum of the wheel in figure ?? is $\vec p = m\vec v$, where $m$ is the wheel’s mass and $\vec v$ is the velocity of the wheel’s center. The rotation contributes nothing to the total momentum.

Newton’s example with the connected globes illustrates how this trick works. The rotation contributes to the velocity of each globe, but the contributions are exactly equal and opposite. If the rotation is increasing the velocity of one globe, it is decreasing the velocity of the other. If it is giving an upward component to the velocity of one globe it is giving a downward component to the velocity of the other.  These equal and opposite contributions cancel in the calculation of the total momentum. The situation is the same for any symmetrical object – like a disk, ball, or rod – where the rotation’s contribution to a part on one side is canceled by an equal and opposite contribution to an identical part on the oposite side. For example, every part of a wheel has a matching part on the opposite side, ensuring the cancelation.

If the object is not symmetrical we force the issue by finding a point where the cancelation happens anyway. The simplest case, and the only case you need to be able to do on you own, is two unequal globes connected by a rigid rod. In the spirit of Du Châtelet, we will consider simple masses $m\sub{A} = 3\units{kg}$ and $m\sub{B} = 1\units{kg}$, shown in figure ??. Rotation about the rod’s midpoint gives equal and opposite contributions to the globe’s velocities, but not equal and opposite contributions to their momenta. The contribution to the heavy globe’s momentum will be three times larger than the contribution to the lighter globe’s momentum, so these contributions will not cancel in the calculation of the total momentum.

Let’s abandon the midpoint and instead rotate about a point that is closer to the heavy globe. Then the rotation will make a smaller contribution to the heavy globe’s velocity while making a larger contribution to the lighter globe’s velocity. If we pick the point so that the contributions to the velocities are in the ratio of one-to-three, then multiplying by the masses, which are in the ratio of three-to-one, will give the equal and opposite contributions to the momentum. This point is the \emph{center of mass.} Every object has a center of mass, a point about which any rotation will produce no momentum. The larger the difference in the masses, the farther the center of mass is shifted toward the heavier mass.

Finding the center of mass for a more complicated object is difficult, but always possible. Any object’s total momentum is $\vec p = m \vec v$ where $m$ is the object’s mass and $\vec v$ is the velocity of the object’s center of mass. The total momentum always obeys conservation of momentum,
\startformula
	\vec p\si + \vec F\sn\Delta t = \vec p\sf,
\stopformula
where $\vec F\sn$ is the total of all external forces acting on any part of the object. The rotation can be totally ignored.

The rotation cannot be ignored in the calculation of the total kinetic energy, because the rotation’s contribution to the kinetic energies of different parts never cancel out. Rotation always increases the total kinetic energy. Even so, there is a trick that makes the calculation rather direct: simply add the kinetic energy due to the rotation to the kinetic energy of the center of mass to find the total kinetic energy.
\startformula
	K = K\sub{CoM} + K\sub{rot}
\stopformula
The kinetic energy of the center of mass and the kinetic energy due to rotation about the center of mass make totally independent contributions to the total kinetic energy. This is another special property of the center of mass.

The center of mass’s kinetic energy can be found using the center of mass’s velocity $\vec v$ or the total momentum $\vec p$.
\startformula
	K\sub{CoM} = \half mv^2 = \frac{p^2}{2m},
\stopformula
where $m$ is the total mass, $v$ is the center of mass’s speed, and $p$ is the magnitude of the total momentum. The formula using the magnitude of the total momentum is especially convenient because you don’t need to know anything about where the center of mass is or how it is moving.
%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Find the center of mass’s kinetic energy for Newton’s connected globes. Use Du Châtelet’s masses and speeds (with units). Each globe has a mass of $1\units{kg}$.

\startsolution
When finding the center of mass’s kinetic energy, the motion due to rotation can be ignored. We only need the speed due to the center of mass’s motion, which is $v = 1\units{m/s}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The only challenge remaining is to find the kinetic energy due to the rotation about the center of mass. This requires adding all of the parts’ kinetic energies, using their speeds due to the rotation. For Newton’s connected globes, the speeds are the same, making this fairly simple.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The total kinetic energy calculated using $K = K\sub{CoM} + K\sub{rot}$ in this example matches the total energy calculated in example ?? when we used the method $K = K\sub{A} + K\sub{B}$. This is a good sign!
These two methods should give the same answer, but there is an important difference in the calculation. In example ?? we found the total kinetic in specific orientations – perpendicular to and aligned with the line of motion. These orientation were chosen because the total velocity was easy to find in those orientations. Other orientations are significantly more challenging. The total kinetic energy was the same in each orientation, but the kinetic energies of each globe changed from one orientation to the other.

The method above, using $K = K\sub{CoM} + K\sub{rot}$, avoided all of these complications because the center of mass kinetic energy $K\sub{CoM}$ and the kinetic energy due to rotation $K\sub{rot}$ are both independent of the orientation. We find them once, and they stay the same throughout the motion.

Finding $K\sub{rot}$ for more complicated shapes is, of course, more complicated. The object’s different parts move at different speed depending on their distance from the center of mass. This not only complicates the calculation, it also creates a dilemma about how to quantify the speed of rotation: With so many speeds to chose from, which best describes the speed of rotation? The best solution is to ignore the individual parts and look at the rate at which the object’s orientation is changing. This rate is called the angular velocity, represented by $\omega$ (omega), it is the rate at which the orientation angle $\theta$ (theta) is changing.
\startformula
	\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
\stopformula
Although the parts have different velocities, they all share the same angular velocity, moving through the same angular displacement $\Delta \theta$ in the same duration $\Delta t$. Angular velocity is directional, its sign indicating whether the object is rotating in the direction of increasing or decreasing angle.

The angular displacement $\Delta \theta$ can be measured in different units. We will use degrees, radians, and cycles. They are related by
\startformula
	1\units{cyc} = 2\pi\units{rad} = 360\degree
\stopformula
Degrees have been a common choice, for physicists and astronomers as well as for non-specialists. Cycles are also common. In fact, you have already used cycles when studying the circular motion of planets and moons over many cycles. The number of cycles $N$ is the very large angular displacement $\Delta \theta$ written in units of cycles, $N = \Delta \theta$. Likewise, frequency is angular velocity written in units of cycles per second.
\startformula
	f = \frac{N}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = \omega
\stopformula
The only things new in angular displacement and angular velocity are the symbols and flexibility with units. By tradition, $N$ and $f$ always use cycles while $\theta$ and $\omega$ can use any angular units.

Degrees are familiar and cycles are sensible, but I want to introduce you to your new best friend: radians. You probably recognize radians from a math class, but it is possible you didn’t really hit it off. In physics you will get to really work with radians, and it is going to be great. Radians will help you work through difficult issues with angular units, but not in a demanding way like other units. If you need angular units, radian will cheerfully jump in to help. If you want to do something with other units, radians will stay out of your way.

Radians are able to do this because an angle’s measure in radians is defined by a ratio. Draw an arc inside any angle, as in figure ??, and the ratio of the arc length $s$ to the radius $r$ is the angle $\theta$ in radians.
\startformula
	\theta = \frac{s}{r}
\stopformula
Of course, $s$ and $r$ are both lengths and should have the same units, so the units on the right cancel out. However, you need angular units for $\theta$ on the left. Radians cheerfully step in to provide the units. You don’t have to do anything else.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\startexample[ex:RadiansLatitude]
Latitude and longitude are measured in degrees. Latitude goes from $0\degree$ at the equator to $90\unit{\degree N}$ at the North Pole (and $90\unit{\degree S}$ at the South Pole). Florence is $??\units{km}$ north of the equator. What is Florence’s latitude?
\startsolution
Using Earth’s radius for $r$, we can find the angle, which is the latitude.
\startformula
	\theta = \frac{s}{r} = \frac{??\units{km}}{??\units{km}} = ??
\stopformula
We have a number, but no units. This is where radians step in to help. Any time you want angular units, just put in radians and continue with unit conversions if necessary.
\startformula
	\theta = ??\units{rad} = ??\units{rad}\left(\frac{360\degree}{2\pi\units{rad}}\right) = ??\degree
\stopformula
Florence’s latitude is $??\unit{\degree N}$. Thanks, radians!

When you don’t need angular units anymore, radians will step out gracefully.

\startexample[ex:RadiansEratosthenes]
On a summer bicycle tour of Egypt you decide to reproduce Eratosthenes’ measurement of Earth’s radius (see p.??). Eratosthenes measured the shadow in Alexandria to be one fiftieth of a circle, or $0.02\units{cyc}$. With a more precise measurement, you find that it is actually $??\units{cyc}$. After carefully calibrating your odometer you measure the distance between Alexandria and the well in Syene to be $??\units{km}$. Based on your measurements, what is Earth’s radius?
\startsolution
You have the arclength $s$ and the angle $\theta$. Solve for $s$ and plug in your measurements.

\NC	r		\NC = \frac{s}{\theta} = \frac{??\units{km}}{??\units{cyc}} = ??\units{km/cyc}	\NR
\stopmathalignment\stopformula
We have not made a mistake, but the units don’t make any sense. The cycles are not welcome. Let’s convert to our friend radians and see what happens.
\startformula
	r = ??\units{km/cyc}\left(\frac{1\units{cyc}}{2\pi\units{rad}}\right) = ??\units{km/rad} = ??\units{km}
\stopformula
Since we only need kilometers for our units, radians just disappeared. Earth’s radius is $??\units{km}$. Farewell, radians!
\stopsolution
\stopexample

Whenever you need angular units, put in radians. If you need $1/\unit{rad}$ or $\unit{rad^2}$, put it in. Afterwards, convert to other angular units if you need to. If you have angular units you don’t need, convert them to radians and let them disappear. No other unit works like this. There when you need them, gone when you don’t, radians are the best!

With the help of our new friend radians, we can relate a rotating object’s many velocities to its one angular velocity $\omega$. Consider a part that is distance $r$ from the center of mass, so that it travels along a circle of radius $r$ around the center of mass as the object rotates. When the object rotates though an angular displacement of $\Delta\theta$ the part moves along the circle a distance $s = r\Delta\theta$. The part’s speed is therefore,
\startformula
	v = \frac{s}{\Delta t} = \frac{r\Delta\theta}{\Delta t} = r\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t} = r\omega. 
\stopformula
The {\sc si} units for $v$ on the left are $\unit{m/s}$. The units on the right should be converted to $\unit{m\.rad/s}$ which turn into $\unit{m/s}$ when the radians disappear.

Knowing the part’s speed allows us to calculate that part’s rotational kinetic energy. Adding these together for all of the parts gives the object’s rotational kinetic energy.

This rotational kinetic energy can be added to the center of mass’s kinetic energy to give the object’s total kinetic energy.

Two globes, with masses $m\sub{A} = 3.0units{kg}$ and $m\sub{B} = 1.0\units{kg}$, are connected by a light, rigid, $1.0\units{m}$ long, as shown. The whole thing is moving with a speed of $1.0\units{m/s}$ while it rotates with an angular velocity of $2.0\units{rad/s}$. Find the magnitude of the total momentum and find the total kinetic energy.
\startsolution
The total momentum is $\vec p = m\vec v$. The rotation has no effect.
\startformula
	p = mv = 4.0\units{kg}\cdot 1.0\units{m/s} = 4.0\units{kg\.m/s}.

The center of mass’s kinetic energy is
\startformula
	K\sub{CoM} = \frac{p^2}{2m} = \frac{(4.0\units{kg\.m/s})^2}{2(4.0\units{kg})} = 2.0\units{J}.
\stopformula
The rotational kinetic energy is the hard part. First, we must find this object’s center of mass, since that will be the center of rotation. The masses are in the ratio of three-to-one, so the distances $r\sub{A}$ and $r\sub{B}$ must be in the ratio of one-to-three. For a $1.0\units{m}$ rod this is achieved by $r\sub{A} = 0.25\units{m}$ and $r\sub{B} = 0.75\units{m}$. These distances allow us to find the individual globes’ speeds due to the rotation using $v = r\omega$. The rotational kinetic energy is

\NC 			\NC = \half I\omega^2		\NR
\stopmathalignment\stopformula
where $I = \left(m\sub{A}r\sub{A}^2 + m\sub{B}r\sub{B}^2\right)$. Next we calculate $I$ and put that value in the simple formula for $K\sub{rot}$ above.
\startformula\startmathalignment
\NC	I	\NC = m\sub{A}r\sub{A}^2 + m\sub{B}r\sub{B}^2						\NR
\NC 		\NC = (3.0\units{kg^2})(0.12\units{m})^2 + (3.0\units{kg^2})(0.12\units{m})^2	\NR
\NC 		\NC = 0.75\units{kg^2\.m^2}										\NR
\stopmathalignment\stopformula

\NC			\NC = \half (0.75\units{kg^2\.m^2})(2.0\units{r/s})^2	\NR
\NC			\NC = 1.5\units{J}							\NR

Finally, we add the center of mass’s kinetic energy to the rotational kinetic energy to get the total kinetic energy.
\startformula
K = K\sub{CoM} + K\sub{rot} = 2.0\units{J} + 1.5\units{J} = 3.5\units{J}

In the middle of the above example we found a simple formula for the rotational kinetic energy
\startformula
	K\sub{rot} = \half I\omega^2
\stopformula
This formula works for all shapes. The rotational kinetic energy is a sum of $\onehalf mv^2$ for all of the parts. The parts have different masses and distances from the center of mass, but they all share the same angular velocity. No matter how many parts the object has, the angular velocity $\omega$ will factor out of the sum (as will the half). This leaves the total $mr^2$, which is called the \emph{moment of inertia.} The moment of inertial depends only on how the object is built – the masses and distances – not on how it is moving.

This rotational kinetic energy formula looks very similar to the usual $K = \onehalf mv^2$, and

In addition to arguments using Newtonian physics, Du Châtelet cited specific experiments, like ’s Gravesande’s, providing further evidence for momentum and \visviva, and evidence against Descartes' quantity of motion. Du Châtelet understood the difference between Newton's successful momentum and Descartes' failed quantity of motion, and she drove a wedge between the two as she defended \visviva.
%Du Châtlet's arguments must have confounded the Cartesians terribly. They viewed themselves as Newton's defenders, but challenging her arguments for Leibniz's \visviva\ would mean abandoning Newton as well!
Fifty-three years after Newton's \booktitle{Principia}, this reckoning was long overdue. 

%We can see how Du Châtelet's Newtonian arguments work by looking again at the case of the cart pushing the block. The goal of this calculation is to find the work work done by the cart and block when they start with initial velocity $v\si$. We may find that work is proportoinal to their quantity of motion ($m\abs{v}$), their \visviva\ ($mv^2$), or something else entirely. A clear result should resolve the \visviva\ debate, at least for this case. I warn you that this discussion is the most advanced so far in this book. You may need to read it several times. I recommend ignoring all of the minus signs initially. Then, when you feel you understand the course of the argument, read it again paying attention to the valuable directional information provided by these signs.
%
%To calculate the work done during the slide we need the force exerted by the block on the track and the displacement of the block and cart from the beginning of the slide until the end. We do not know the force, but we can calculate the displacement $\Delta x$. We will start with displacement and hope for the best.
%
%The final displacement at the end of the slide is the product of average velocity $v\sub{ave.}$ during the slide and the duration of the slide $\Delta t$. 
%\startformula
%	\Delta x = v\sub{ave.} \Delta t % = v\sub{ave.}\frac{mv\si}{F}
%\stopformula
%Since the cart and block slow uniformly from their initial velocity to a complete stop, their \emph{average} velocity during this time is half of the initial velocity, $v\sub{ave.} = \half v\si$.
%\startformula
%	\Delta x = \half v\si \Delta t
%\stopformula
%
%The time required for the block to slow to a complete stop can be found using Newton's conservation of momentum.
%\startformula\startmathalignment 
%	p\sf &= p\si + F\Delta t		\\
%	F\Delta t &= \cancel{p\sf} - p\si		\\
%	\Delta t &= -\frac{mv\si}{F}
%\stopmathalignment \stopformula
%Do not be alarmed by the minus sign. It will not give a negative time! The force is always opposite the motion. If the initial velocity positive, then the force is negative and the change in time is positive, as it should be.
%
%%We saw in Chapter \in[ch:Momentum] that the time required for the cart and block to reach a stop is 
%%\startformula
%%	\Delta t = \frac{p\si}{F} = \frac{mv\si}{F}
%%\stopformula
%%Recall when we studied this problem in Chapter \in[ch:Momentum], we chose the velocity to be in the positive direction, so the momentum is positive as well. We also chose $F$ to be the force that the block exerts on the track, so that it is also positive.
%
%This change in time can now be used to find the displacement as the block slows to a stop.
%\startformula
%	\Delta x = \half v\si \left(-\frac{mv\si}{F}\right) = -\frac{mv\si^2}{2F}
%\stopformula
%Here we see that the displacement $\Delta x$ is proportional to the \visviva, not the momentum $mv$. (The minus sign ensures the displacement and the force are in opposite directions, as they should be.) This displacement similar to the effect that ’s Gravesande saw when he dropped balls into clay, also confirming \visviva\ rather than momentum as the correct predictor of the motion's effect.

%%, just as we saw in the data for the cart pushing the block. In fact, we can use the slope of the line on the graph to determine the force.
%%\begin{gather*}
%%	\text{slope}=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}= \frac{mv^2}{\Delta x} = 2F \\

%%’s Gravesande originally measured the impact craters in the clay because their size revealed how much work was done by the impacting sphere, work that came from the sphere's \visviva. We measured the displacement of the sliding block because it likewise revealed the work done by the block. Since we have calculated the relationship between the block's displacement and the \visviva, we can finish making the connection by finding the work done.
%Finally, we can use this displacement to find the work done by the block. Since $F$ is the force \emph{on} the block, the work done \emph{by} the block will be $W = -F\Delta x$. This work will be positive because the force on the block $F$ is opposite the displacement $\Delta x$.  
%\startformula
%	W = -F\Delta x = -\cancel{F}\left(-\frac{mv\si^2}{2\cancel{F}}\right) = \half mv^2
%\stopformula
%%The force cancels out!
%The work done by the sliding block is half of the system's initial \visviva. Stated the other way, \visviva\ is a measure of the work that can be done, which each unit of work requiring two units of \visviva. Leibniz is correct, as show by the careful use of Newtonian physics!
%
%The cancelation of the force $F$ deserves a bit more comment. If the force is big, then the cart and block only slide a short distance. If the force is small, then they slide farther, doing the same amount of work over a larger distance. The work done depends only on the initial \visviva\ of the cart and block. The force determines the distance over which that work is done.

%Today we always use half of the \visviva, $\half mv^2$, which is called the kinetic energy. The work $W$ done by the cart and block is equal to their initial kinetic energy $\half mv^2$. I will have more to say about kinetic energy in a moment. First, I wish to finish the story of Emily Du Châtelet and the \visviva\ debate.

Du Châtelet immediately faced two attacks. Even before \booktitle{Foundations} was published, her former tutor, Samuel König, falsely claimed the work was his and that Du Châtelet had simply taken his dictation to produce \booktitle{Foundations}. %König expected his claim was taken seriously because few intellectuals of the time could not imagine a woman producing a work of such sophistication.
Historian Judith P.\ Zinsser describes the second challenge faced by Du Châtelet.
\startblockquote
	The second attack in the spring of 1741 came from Dortous de Mairan, newly appointed the secretary of the Academy of Sciences. Initially, he had thanked Du Châtelet for having sent him a copy of her book. Reading her final chapter, the explicit attack on his work, must have been an unwelcome surprise. Angered by the veiled sarcasm in which she had presented his views, he saw himself as the champion, not only of the Cartesian formula he had defended in 1728 against Bernoulli but also the Academy of Sciences, now challenged by a young noblewoman. He quickly formulated a pamphlet that he distributed throughout the Republic of Letters that portrayed Du Châtelet as a silly coquette, seduced by Leibnizian ideas when she should have accepted those of men wiser and better than she. Du Châtelet surprised him again, however, and answered his pamphlet point by point in a style contemporaries acknowledged was his equal in wit and daring. Probably at the insistence of his friends, Dortous de Mairan let the matter drop.\autocite{107--108}{Zinsser2009}
\stopblockquote

Du Châtelet composed her detailed response in only three weeks, demonstrating her brilliance and thereby removing any doubt that she was the true author of \booktitle{Foundations of Physics}.

\startblockquote
	The controversy, and the approval and acclaim for the \booktitle{Foundations} from mathematicians and physicists in England, France and Germany\dots secured Du Châtelet's reputation as a member of the elite, intellectual world of the Republic of Letters.\autocite{108}{Zinsser2009}
\stopblockquote

%\'Emilie du Châtelet was determined to understand both views. She discovered that there are actually two distinct types of \visviva\ that coexist in motion. She even demonstrated used Newton's formulation to argue for Leibniz's formula! It was a brilliant achievement and demonstrated that the two types of \visviva\ are complementary.
Newton was already widely revered. Du Châtelet's \booktitle{Foundations of Physics} made his physics widely understood. \booktitle{Foundations} cured the persistent confusion underlying the \visviva\ controversy and spread Leibniz's insight to many who had dismissed him.

\section{High energy physics}
High-energy experiments done in the twentieth century revealed that the formula $K=\onehalf mv^2$ is not correct for speeds close to the speed of light ($3\sci{8}\units{m/s}$), just like the formula for momentum. Also like the formula for momentum, this kinetic energy formula is \emph{extremely} accurate for lower speeds (anything less than $10^7\units{m/s}$). For higher speed we will need to use updated formulas in Volume II.

Conservation of energy in its many forms is a bit more complicated that Leibniz's original idea for conservation of \visviva, but added complexity also makes energy extremely useful. Food, fuel, and batteries all contain energy stored in other forms that can be converted into kinetic energy.

The conservation laws for momentum and energy have survived every experimental test and are thought to be among the most fundamental laws of nature. They can be used in every situation, from the interactions of quarks inside a proton to the stretching of space and time over the vast scales of the cosmos. Learn them and use them. They are treasures.

\startexample[ex:cartK]
	The block slides $16.0\units{cm}$ along the track against a friction force of $-0.50\units{N}$ (The force is negative, opposing the block's positive motion). What is the work done by the block?
\startsolution
The work done by the block is found using the work formula, but take care to use the correct force between the block and the track. The work done by the block is calculated using the force \emph{of} the block, but we are given the force \emph{on} the block. Newton's third law tells us that the force of the block on the track is equal and opposite to the force of the track on the block. Therefore, we will calculate the work using $F=0.50\units{N}$ for the force of the block on the track.
