\Initial{G}{alileo's confident advocacy}
for the heliocentric model provoked a fierce response from influential philosophers and theologians.
Most of their arguments seem quite unconvincing in retrospect, but the philosophers did offer one compelling piece of evidence for their model. They argued that anyone can tell the difference between moving and not moving. A person on a galloping horse could never be persuaded that the horse was standing still as a statue. But in heliocentric model everyone moves at tremendous speed, far faster than any horse! How could this breathtaking motion go completely unnoticed by everybody? 
Why trust Galileo's evidence, gathered with his mysterious telescope, when it contradicts our everyday experience?

To counter this common-sense argument against the heliocentric model, Galileo turned his attention to motion experiments here on Earth.
He set out to explain why moving with the Earth does not seem like moving at all.
Fortunately, Galileo knew a few things about motion. Before his adventures with the telescope, Galileo had studied motion carefully, probably more carefully than anyone before him.
Galileo employed the empirical methods that his father, Vincenzo, had used in musical research.
Galileo quantified all of his ideas about motion in terms of distances traveled and the time elapsed. He then developed methods for accurately measuring time. Finally, he subjected his ideas to experimental tests, revising his model of motion and improving his experiments.

Unfortunately, nobody else knew anything about Galileo's model of motion, because Galileo had not published his results.
After \booktitle{Sidereal Messenger} brought him fame in 1610, Galileo began working on a comprehensive argument for the heliocentric model, which would include his improved model of motion.
Rather than completing this project, Galileo was drawn into a tedious series of disputes with other astronomers, philosophers, and religious leaders.
These arguments dragged on for two decades, and won him few friends.

Finally, in 1632, Galileo published a detailed discussion of his observations and their implications in the book \booktitle{Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems, Ptolemaic and Copernican,} (hearafter, \booktitle{Two World Systems}).
The book's dialogue is between the characters Salviati and Simplicio.
Salviati is named after Galileo’s sharp witted friend, Filippo Salviati, who died many years before Galileo’s homage in \booktitle{Two World Systems}. Salviati presents Galileo's arguments in favor of  Copernicus' heliocentric model.

Simplicio represents another of Galileo’s friends, an Aristotelian philosopher who defends Ptolemy's geocentric model. Galileo gently mocked this well educated friend, \quotation{who seemed to have no greater obstacle to the understanding of the truth than the fame he had acquired in Aristotelian interpretation.} \autocite{p.~192}{Galileo1632}
Rather than using the friend’s name, Galileo named his character Simplicio after the great sixth century Aristotelian commentator, Simplicius.
You may notice that the commentator’s Italian name, Simplicio, sounds like \quotation{simpleton.} In Italian, the name and the insult are identical.
 
In spite of these rhetorical handicaps, Simplicio enters the debate well prepared and confident.
The geocentric model is almost universally accepted, and agrees with our natural sense that Earth is motionless.
Simplicio's strongest defenses are a series of simple experiments, each providing further evidence that Earth is motionless.
Many of these experiments had been discussed for centuries, going all the way back to Aristotle.
These experiments support the common-sense models of motion we developed as children.
Indeed, the strongest evidence for a motionless Earth is from the most childish experiment, described by Salviati.
%In \booktitle{Two World Systems}, Salviati and Simplicio discuss the most compelling experimental evidence for a motionless Earth.

\startblockquote
	{\sc Salv.} As the strongest reason, everyone produces the one from heavy bodies, which when falling down from on high move in a straight line perpendicular to the earth’s surface. This is regarded as an unanswerable argument that the earth is motionless. For, if it were in a state of diurnal [daily] rotation, and a rock were dropped from the top of a tower, then during the time taken by the rock in its fall, the tower (being carried by the earth’s turning), would advance many hundreds of cubits toward the east and the rock should hit the ground that distance away from the tower’s base. \autocite{p.~215}{Galileo1632}
\stopblockquote

We all know, from our own experience, that a rock naturally falls downward, toward Earth’s center, as shown in figure \in[fig:RockDropGeocentric]. This natural downward motion can be blocked by an obstacle, like the ground or a table, or even reversed by a person lifting the rock. However, as soon the obstacle or outside force is removed, the natural downward motion resumes. These facts, solemnly stated by Aristotle and gleefully confirmed by toddlers everywhere, demand that the rock falls straight down.

Regarding the motion of the tower, recall that Earth’s size was known even in Aristotle’s time (\at{p.}[Eratosthenes]).
If Earth makes a full rotation every day, a tower in Greece or Italy would be carried by Earth’s rotation at an amazing $330\units{m/s}$ toward the east (example \in[ex:EarthSurfaceSpeed] in the previous chapter).
A rock dropped from the $85\units{m}$ tower in Florence would take about $4.2\units{s}$ to reach the ground. %(example \in[])
In that time, the tower would move $1400\units{m}$ to the east, as shown in figure \in[fig:RockDropAristotle]. If Aristotle’s reasoning were correct, the rock would hit the ground $1.4\units{km}$ to the west of the tower’s base.

Of course, the rock does not land far to the west; it lands right at the tower’s base.
You may know\dash or think you know\dash the flaw in Aristotle's argument. If so, you can still understand why the argument was persuasive, and you will appreciate the evidence Galileo presents to challenge this common-sense argument. If you do not know the flaw\dash or are not sure you know\dash even better! Galileo himself will help you revise your model of motion to better match the real world.

Galileo’s explanation rests on his first profound insight into motion: objects continue moving without any external force propelling them. Continued motion is completely natural; only \emph{change} in motion requires an outside force.
Galileo shared this insight first in \booktitle{Two World Systems}. \quotation{So, tell me,} Salviati inquires,
\startblockquote
	\dots suppose you had a plane surface very polished like a mirror and made of a hard material like steel; suppose it was not parallel to the horizon but somewhat inclined; and suppose that on it you place a perfectly spherical ball made of a heavy and very hard material like bronze, for example; what do you think it would do when released? [figure \in[fig:ballinclinestart]]
\stopblockquote

\noindent Simplicio answers,
\startblockquote
	%{\sc Simp.}
	\dots I am sure that it would spontaneously move downward along the incline. [figure \in[fig:ballinclinedown]]

	{\sc Salv.} \dots Now how long would the ball’s motion last, and what speed would it have? Notice that I am referring to a perfectly round ball and a fastidiously polished plane, in order to remove all external and accidental impediments; similarly, I want you to disregard the impediment offered by the air through its resistance to being parted, and any other accidental obstacles there may be.

	{\sc Simp.} I understand everything very well. As for your question, I answer that the ball would continue to move ad infinitum, as far as the inclination of the plane extends; that it would move with continuously accelerated motion, for such is the nature of falling bodies, which \quotation{acquire strength as they keep going}; and that the greater the inclination, the greater would be the speed.

	{\sc Salv.} However, if someone wanted to have the ball move upward along the same surface, do you think it would move that way?

	{\sc Simp.} Not spontaneously; but it would if dragged along or thrown by force.

	{\sc Salv.} So, if it were propelled by some impetus forcibly impressed on it, what would its motion be and how long would it last?\textreference{SalvImpetus}

	{\sc Simp.} Its motion would keep on being continuously reduced and retarded, due to its being against nature; and it would last more or less depending on the greater or smaller impulse and on the steeper or gentler inclination. [figure \in[fig:ballinclineup]]

	{\sc Salv.} Therefore, I think that up to now you have explained to me the following properties of a body moving along a plane in two different directions: when descending on an inclined plane, the heavy body is spontaneously and continuously accelerated, and it requires the use of force to keep it at rest; on the other hand, in an ascending path a force is needed to make it move that way (as well as to keep it at rest), and the motion impressed on it is continuously diminishing, so that eventually it is annihilated. You also say that in both cases there is a difference stemming from the greater or smaller inclination of the plane; so that a greater inclination leads to a greater downward speed, but on an upward path the same body thrust by the same force moves a greater distance when the inclination is less.
	%[Finocchiaro, p.229-231]
	Now tell me what would happen to the same body on a surface that is not inclined.

	{\sc Simp.} Here I must think a little before I answer. Since there is no downward slope, there cannot be a natural tendency to move; since there is no upward slope, there cannot be a resistance to being moved; thus, the body would  be indifferent to motion, and have neither a propensity nor a resistance to it; I think, therefore, that it should remain there naturally at rest\dots.

	{\sc Simp.} It would move in that direction.

	{\sc Salv.} But with what sort of motion? A continuously accelerated one, as on a downward slope, or a progressively retarded one, as on an upward slope?

	{\sc Simp.} I see no cause for acceleration or retardation since there is neither descent nor ascent. [figure \in[fig:ballroll]]

	{\sc Salv.} Yes. But if there is no cause for retardation, still less is there cause for rest. So, how long do you think the moving body would remain in motion?

	{\sc Simp.} As long as the extension of that surface which is sloping neither upward nor downward.

	{\sc Salv.} Therefore, if such a surface were endless, the motion on it would likewise be endless, namely, perpetual?

	{\sc Simp.} I think so, as long as the moving body was made of durable material.

	{\sc Salv.} This has already been supposed, for we have already said that all accidental and external impediments should be removed, and in this regard the body’s fragility is one of the accidental impediments.

\stopblockquote
Salviati has convinced Simplicio that an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an external force.

To understand how Galileo used this insight to solve the problem of the falling rock, it is necessary for us to develop some mathematical language for discussing the various motions in the problem. First, we will describe uniform motion, like the horizontal motion of the tower or the ball rolling on the level surface. Then, we will describe accelerated motion, like the motion of the falling rock or the ball rolling on an inclined surface. Finally, Salviati and Simplicio will put these pieces together to explain why the rock dropped from the tower lands at the tower’s base. The basic elements of Galileo’s mathematical model are position, displacement, and velocity. We will develop these ideas in the next few sections, and we will continue to use them as we create our mathematical model of motion in later chapters.

\noindent
Before returning to the falling rock, we will first understand Galileo's mathematical description of the rolling ball.
A meter stick has been placed below the rolling ball in figure \in[fig:levelrollingball].
%The marks start with $0\units{cm}$ at one end and go to $45\units{cm}$ at the other.
Marks on the meter stick identify the ball’s position, represented by the variable $x$.
%\footnote{This track has zero at one end and only positive numbers, so the address is a measurement of how far the cart is from the \quotation{zero} end of the track. It would be perfectly acceptable for the track to have zero in the middle with positive numbers on one side and negative on the other. In that case positive addresses would give the distance to one side of track’s center, while negative numbers would give the distances on the other side. If my track extended in both directions to the horizon, I would certainly want to put zero near where I was working and measure distances from there.}
These positions, measured at the ball’s center, are listed in table \in[T:levelroll]. The \keyterm{motion graph} in figure \in[fig:LevelRollGraph], shows the ball’s position as a function of time. Notice that motion graph's axes are not labeled $x$ and $y$ as they typically are in math class. Here, the horizontal axis is the time $t$, and the vertical axis is the position $x$.

A \keyterm{displacement} is a change in position. In figure \in[fig:BallLevelArows], the ball’s displacements are shown as arrows extending from the ball’s position at one time to its position at a later time. The displacement’s length must be the actual distance moved by the ball. When the ball moves $12\units{cm}$ to the right, the displacement should be $12\units{cm}$ long, extending from center to center and pointing to the right.

Like position, displacement can be quantified. %The number needs to give not only this distance moved by the object, but also the direction.
Our meter stick has numbers increasing to the right, so we will use positive displacements to describe motions to the right and negative displacements to describe motions to the left. For example, a movement of $12\units{cm}$ to the right will be represented by a displacement of $12\units{cm}$, while a movement of $12\units{cm}$ to the left will be represented by a displacement of $-12\units{cm}$.

\noindent
%We have seen displacements before, primarily in Chapter \in[ch:Music]. For vibrations the displacement was always the change in position measured from the central position.
In \in{example}[ex:CartDisp], the \keyterm{distance} traveled by the cart is $24.0\units{cm}$.
Distance is the displacement's absolute value, $\abs{\Delta x}$.
For the cart in \in{example}[ex:CartDisp], the distance traveled is
\startformula
	\abs{\Delta x} = \abs{-24.0\units{cm}} = 24.0\units{cm}.
\stopformula
Distance does not tell us anything about direction, so we will find displacements more useful.


Physics' greatest power is prediction. Predictions often relate to changes, such as changes in position.
If we know the cart's initial position, $x\sub{i}$, and know its displacement, $\Delta x$, we can predict its final position, $x\sub{f}$. Initial position plus displacement gives the final position.
\startformula
	 x\sub{i} + \Delta x \NC= x\sub{f}
\stopformula
Notice that the sign of the displacement is necessary to get the correct final position. If the cart starts at $20\units{cm}$ and %moves a \emph{distance} of $5\units{cm}$ it could end up at $25\units{cm}$, $15\units{cm}$ or (by changing direction) anywhere in between. If the \emph{displacement} is
is displaced $5\units{cm}$, then it moves in the positive direction and will end at $25\units{cm}$. A displacement of $-5\units{cm}$ would move the cart form $20\units{cm}$ to $15\units{cm}$. %Many important physics laws have the form \quotation{initial plus change is final.}
(When we have mathematical models for more interesting systems, we will make more interesting predictions!)

\section{Uniform motion and constant velocity}
% Could actually use a Galileo quote here. It would be from the Uniform Motion section of Day III in \booktitle{Two New Sciences.} This is missing from Finocchiaro.
Galileo observed that an object moving without impediment, like the ball on the horizontal plane, will continue to move.  During such uniform motion, the object’s displacement is proportional to the motion’s duration.  The object will have a small displacement in a short time, but during a longer time the object will have a proportionally larger displacement.
The constant ratio of $\Delta x$ to $\Delta t$ is the \keyterm{velocity}.
\highlightbox{
\startformula
	v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
		= \frac{x\sub{f}-x\sub{i}}{t\sub{f}-t\sub{i}}
%	\label{eq:1Dv}
\stopformula
}%\end{shaded}
We will remember velocity as \quotation{displacement over duration.}
Outside forces can change an object’s velocity, but as long as it moves freely its velocity will be constant.

%We will always calculate the amount of time elapsed $\Delta t$ as a positive number by subtracting the initial time $t\si$ from the final time $t\sf$.  (The equations still work when going backward in time, but it gets confusing.)

\noindent
Velocity is a \keyterm{vector}. All vectors are represented by straight arrows like the one in figure \in[fig:CartVel]. Vectors have a direction, which is obviously the arrow’s direction, and a \keyterm{magnitude}, which is represented by the arrow’s length. Diagrams must have a scale for converting the arrow’s length to the vector’s magnitude, as in figure \in[fig:CartVel].

The magnitude of velocity is \keyterm{speed}, found by taking the velocity's absolute value, $\abs{v}$. Speed is always positive for a moving object, independent of the motion’s direction. The familiar formula for speed is \quotation{distance over time.} In our language, speed is \quotation{distance over duration.}
\startformula
	\abs{v} = \frac{\abs{\Delta x}}{\Delta t}
\stopformula
%If the object is moving, both distance and duration are positive, so the formula gives a positive speed. If the object is not moving, the displacement, distance, and speed are all zero.

%Speed is the quantity shown on a car’s speedometer. The speedometer shows a positive value when you drive to school and still shows a positive value when you drive home. A velocimeter would have to give a positive value when traveling one direction, and a negative value when traveling the other way.

With an initial position and a constant velocity, you can easily predict an object’s position at a later time. The object's displacement is its velocity times the duration of its motion.
\startformula
	\Delta x	\NC = v\Delta t
\stopformula
%(The direction of the velocity determines the direction of the displacement. If the velocity is negative, the displacement will be in the negative direction; if the velocity is positive, the displacement will be in the positive direction.)

When calculating the velocity from the graph, avoid the common mistake of counting graph squares. This often works in math classes, but it will not work here. For example, seeing a graph go up four squares and over five, you may conclude the velocity is $v=\fourfifths= 0.8$. This is not correct – it does not even have the correct units! You must use the values on the $x$-axis and $t$-axis to do the calculation. Those will give the correct slope with the correct units.

Many students learn in math class that the slope is $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. This formula should not be used in physics because $x$ and $y$ are rarely the horizontal and vertical coordinates. In the graphs above, the coordinates are $t$ and $x$, with $x$ as the \emph{vertical} coordinate rather than the horizontal one. Remember $v = \Delta x / \Delta t$ and use the graph’s axes to determine the correct values and units. %Use the axis units in the calculation to confirm the correct units for the slope.

We will often set $t\si = 0$ to simplify calculations. In this case we use $x_0$ to represent the position at $t=0$. The position at any time $t$ is represented simply by $x$. With this notation, we have a position formula for constant velocity.
\startformula
	x = x_0 + vt.
\stopformula
You might not recognize it immediately, but this is the formula for a straight line. Compare this constant velocity formula to the usual math class formula for a straight line: $y=mx+b$, shown in \in{figure}[fig:linearmath], with initial value $b$ and slope $m$. The position formula for constant velocity has initial value $x_0$ and the slope $v$. For the case of the rolling ball, the position formula becomes
\startformula
	x = 7\units{cm} + 12\units{cm/s}\cdot t.
\stopformula
The motion graph of this straight-line formula is shown in \in{figure}[fig:linearposition].

\section[sec:AccMotion]{Accelerated motion and instantaneous velocity}

Everything you have learned about uniform motion can be adapted to situations where the velocity is changing, like the rock dropped from the tower or the ball on the incline, shown in \in{figure}[fig:inclineacceleratingball]. Since the velocity is changing from one instant to the next, we must adjust the velocity formula to calculate the \keyterm{instantaneous velocity}, the velocity at a particular instant.

As Galileo explained, changing velocity is always caused by an outside force. In Galileo’s examples, the outside force is gravity, which exerts a constant, downward force.
Galileo was able to analyze constant force motion using some very clever geometric tricks.
We would like to analyze motion even when the force is changing.
For this, we need tools developed by Gottfried Leibniz in the late seventeenth century.
(We will meet Leibniz in \in{Chapters}[ch:Momentum] and \in[ch:VisViva], when we study his ideas about motion.)
%, when Isaac Newton and  invented calculus to deal with changing velocities. Newton’s calculus was built on the Galileo’s geometric methods. Leibniz’s calculus, based on algebra, proved more practical.

Leibniz chose initial and final times very close together, so that the velocity is \emph{almost} constant for the brief duration. This is illustrated on the ball’s accelerated motion graph in \in{figure}[fig:BallRollsDown]. To find the instantaneous velocity at $t=0.50\units{s}$, we choose points just before and after that time for our initial and final measurements. The curve between the points has a nearly constant slope, so finding the slope with those points will give a good estimate of the instantaneous velocity at $0.50\units{s}$.

Leibniz introduced a neat notation for instantaneous velocity. He replaced the big $\Delta$ with a small $d$ as a reminder to use small changes in position and time, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:BallRollsDown]. Using Leibniz’s notation, the instantaneous velocity is
\startformula
	v = \frac{dx}{dt}.
\stopformula

How small is small enough? It depends. You will usually want an answer that is correct to two or three significant figures, which means the slope should not change more than a few percent between the initial and final time. If the triangle has no visible curvature on the hypotenuse, then it is probably small enough. The triangle in figure \in[fig:BallRollsDown] appears to be small enough.

Position, displacement, and velocity provide a quantitative description of straight-line motion. Next, we will adapt these tools to the circular motions.

\section{Uniform circular motion and constant angular velocity}

Galileo’s \booktitle{Two World Systems} is not primarily concerned with striaght-line motions, but with the circular motions of the Solar System – of Earth and the other planets around the Sun, of the Moon around Earth, and of Jupiter’s moons around Jupiter. Even the tower is carried along a circular path around Earth’s axis, completing one cycle every day.
Salviati and Simplicio’s discussion of the rolling ball leads them to consider such circular motion.

\startblockquote
	{\sc Salv.} Now, tell me, what do you think is the reason why that ball moves spontaneously on the downward path and not without force on the upward one?

	{\sc Simp.} Because the tendency of heavy bodies is to move toward the center of the earth, only by force do they move upward away from it; and by moving down on an inclined surface one gets closer to the center, and by moving up one gets further away.

	{\sc Salv.} Therefore, a surface sloping neither downward nor upward would have to be equidistant from the center at all of its points. But are there any such surfaces in the world?

	{\sc Simp.} There is no lack of them: one is the surface of our terrestrial globe, if it were smoothed out, and not rough and mountainous, as it is; another is the surface of the water when it is calm and tranquil.

	{\sc Salv.} Therefore, a ship moving in a calm sea is a body going over a surface that slopes neither downward nor upward, and so it has the tendency to move endlessly and uniformly with the impulse once acquired if all accidental and external obstacles are removed.\autocite{pp.~231--232}{Galileo1632}
%
	%{\sc Simp.} It seems that it must be so.

\noindent
In Galileo's model of motion, both circular and straight-line motion continue endlessly unless an outside force acts to alter the motion, as illustrated in \in{figure}[fig:SailEarth].
%This matched his model of the world, in which planets and moon continue their orbits without any external mover to keep them going.
This model of motion drives Galileo’s heliocentric model of the world, in which the planets and moons follow circular paths at constant speed, as shown in figure \in[fig:DialogueSolarSystem]. Planets circle the Sun, while moons circle Earth and Jupiter. 

In \in{Chapter}[ch:Music], we learned to calculate speed along these circular paths using \quotation{distance over duration} (\at{p.}[eq:vT]). With our new symbol for speed, $\abs{v}$, this formula becomes

\noindent
When we study the rotation of solid objects – like Earth – displacement and speed are not as useful. A rotating object's different parts travel different distances at different speeds. Parts near the axis travel more slowly along smaller circles while objects farther from the center travel along longer circles at higher speed. For example, a tower built at the equator will travel Earth's entire circumference every $24$ hours, while the tower in Florence completes a smaller circumference in the same time, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:FlorenceCircle2].
While the object's different parts travel different distances, all parts travel through the same angle as the object rotates. Working with angles will immensely simplify the study of rotating solid objects.

Radians are able to do this because an angle’s measure in radians is defined by a ratio. Draw an arc inside any angle, as in figure~\in[fig:radians], and the ratio of the arc length $s$ to the radius $r$ is the angle $\theta$ in radians.

Of course, $s$ and $r$ are both lengths and should have the same units, so the units on the right cancel out. However, you need angular units for $\theta$ on the left. Radians cheerfully step in to provide the units. You don’t have to do anything else, but if you wish to convert to other angular units, you can.

Whenever you need angular units, put in radians.
Then convert to other angular units if you need to.
If you have angular units you don’t need, convert them to radians and let them disappear.
No other unit works like this.

When an object rotates, its many parts move with different speeds, in many different directions, as they circle the axis. What the parts share is the angle that they travel around the axis. This angle is the \keyterm{angular displacement}, $\Delta\theta$, which is computed like other displacements.
\startformula
	\Delta \theta = \theta\sf - \theta\si
\stopformula
% Saint Petersburg, Russia: 59°56′15″N 30°18′31″E

The angular displacement's rate of change is \keyterm{angular velocity,} represented by $\omega$ (omega).
\startformula
	\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
\stopformula
Although the parts have different velocities, they all share the same angular velocity, moving through the same angular displacement $\Delta \theta$ in the same duration $\Delta t$. Angular velocity is directional, its sign indicating whether the object is rotating in the direction of increasing or decreasing angle. We will usually follow mathematicians' tradition of using positive for counter-clockwise motion and negative for clockwise.

With the help of our new friend radians, we can relate a rotating object’s many speeds to its one angular velocity $\omega$. Consider a part that is distance $r$ from the axis, so that it travels along a circle of radius $r$ as the object rotates. When the object rotates though an angular displacement of $\Delta\theta$ the part moves along the circle a distance $s = r\Delta\theta$. The part’s speed is therefore,

\section{Compound motion}

Now that we have the tools to describe linear and circular motion, we come to Galileo's second profound insight into motion: an object can perform two different types of motion at the same time.
He called this \keyterm{compound motion}.

Let us return to the puzzle of the falling rock (\at{p.}[RockDrop]). We know that the rock is accelerated downward by gravity and lands at the base of the tower. Salviati and Simplicio are considering whether these observations are compatible with a rotating Earth.

\startblockquote
	{\sc Salv.} But if by chance the terrestrial globe were rotating and consequently were also carrying the tower along with it, and if the falling rock were still seen to graze the edge of the tower, what would its motion have to be?

	{\sc Simp.} In that case one would rather have to speak of \quotation{its motions}; for there would be one that would take it from above downward, and it would have to have another in order to follow the course of the tower.

	{\sc Salv.} Therefore, its motion would be a compound of two, namely, one with which it grazes the edge of the tower, and another one with which it follows the tower; the result of this compound would be that the rock would no longer describe a simple straight and perpendicular line, but rather and inclined, and perhaps not straight, one.

	{\sc Simp.} I am not sure about its not being straight; but I understand well that it would have to be inclined and different from the straight perpendicular one it would describe on a motionless earth.\autocite{pp.~223-224}{Galileo1632}
\stopblockquote

\noindent
Is this compound motion to be expected? It is! Before the rock is released, it is carried eastward – along with the tower – by Earth’s rotation. After the rock is released, the only force on the rock is gravity, pulling directly toward Earth’s center and causing the rock to fall. Gravity has no effect on the rock’s horizontal motion, so even as the rock, falls it continues to the east – along with the tower – and lands at the tower’s base, as shown in figure \in[fig:RockDropGalileo].\pagereference[FallingRockArgument]

	{\sc Salv.} First, it is clear that these two motions (namely, the circular around the center and the straight toward the center) are neither contrary nor incompatible nor destructive of each other; for the moving body has no repugnance toward such motion; you yourself already granted that its repugnance is to motion which takes it farther from the center, so it follows necessarily that the moving body has neither repugnance nor propensity to motion that takes it neither farther from nor closer to the center, and consequently there is no reason for any decrease in the power impressed on it\dots . %Moreover, the cause of motion is not a single one, which might diminish on account of the new action; instead there are to distinct causes, of which
	Gravity attends only to drawing the body toward the center, and the impressed power to leading it around the center\dots .%; therefore, there is no reason for an impediment.
	\autocite{p.~233}{Galileo1632}
\stopblockquote
By \quotation{power impressed} Galileo means the motion that the object already possesses, which keeps it moving with the tower. %In Chapter \in[ch:Momentum] we will identify this quantity of motion for straight paths, and in Chapter \in[ch:Rotation] we will adapt the idea for circular paths like the one described here. While Galileo had the right idea, a full formulation required almost two centuries of refinement.

Having solved the puzzle of the falling rock, Galileo adapted the argument  to \emph{all} of the experiments which seemed to prove a motionless Earth – experiments with objects thrown upward or cannon balls fired toward the various points of the compass. In all cases the objects in the experiment move along with Earth before the experiment begins. This shared motion is undetectable because all of the forces in the experiment – the throws, the cannons, gravity – only cause changes in the objects’ motions. But these changes are exactly what they would have been if everything had initially been at rest. There is no indication of the shared motion. Only the \emph{relative} motion can be seen or measured.

Galileo offers some playful experiments to illustrate the difference between shared and relative motion. 
\startblockquote
	{\sc Salv.} Shut yourself up with some friend in the main cabin below decks on some large ship, and have with you there some flies, butterflies, and other small flying animals. Have a large bowl of water with some fish in it; hang up a bottle that empties drop by drop into a narrow-mouthed vessel beneath it. With the ship standing still, observe carefully how the little animals fly with equal speed to all sides of the cabin. The fish swim indifferently in all directions; and the drops fall into the vessel beneath; and, in throwing something to your friend, you need throw it no more strongly in one direction than another, the distances being equal; jumping with your feet together you pass equal spaces in every direction. When you have observed all these things carefully (though there is no doubt that when the ship is standing still everything must happen in this way), have the ship proceed with any speed you like, so long as the motion is uniform and not fluctuating this way and that. You will discover not the least change in all the effects named, nor could you tell from any of them whether the ship was moving or standing still. In jumping, you will pass on the floor the same space as before, nor will you make larger jumps toward the stern than toward the prow even though the ship is moving quite rapidly\dots. %, despite the fact that during the time that you are in the air the floor under you will be going in a direction opposite to your jump.
In throwing something to your companion, you will need no more force to get it to him whether he is in the direction of the bow or the stern\dots. %, with yourself situated opposite. 
The droplets will fall as before into the vessel beneath without dropping toward the stern, although while the drops are in the air the ship runs many spans. The fish in their water will swim toward the front of their bowl with no more effort than toward the back\dots. %, and will go with equal ease to bait placed anywhere around the edges of the bowl. 
Finally, the butterflies and flies will continue their flights indifferently toward every side, nor will it ever happen that they are concentrated toward the stern, as if tired out from keeping up with the course of the ship\dots. %, from which they will have been separated during long intervals by keeping themselves in the air.\dots 
The cause of all these correspondences of effects is the fact that the ship's motion is common to all the things contained in it, and to the air also.
	\autocite{p.~216--218}{Galileo2001}
\stopblockquote
If you have ever been on a large ship, you know that when the motion is uniform, there is no way to determine if the ship is moving without looking outside. You may have experienced the same thing on a bus, train, or airplane when it is traveling with a constant velocity. Shared motion, even when it is hundreds of miles per hour, is not perceptible without an outside reference. Everyone on Earth shares Earth's rapid motion, which we can only recognize by looking beyond Earth to the stars.

The necessity of studying the relative motion, revealed by Galileo, became known as \keyterm{Galilean relativity}.
Galilean relativity resolved the conflict between Earth’s apparent motionlessness and the direct astronomical evidence for Earth’s rapid motion – both its daily rotation and its annual revolution around the Sun.

%[Experimental tests: Dropping the rock from the top of a mast on a moving ship. Dropping something in a car, bus, or plane.]

Galileo’s \booktitle{Two World Systems} and earlier writings on the heliocentric model caught the disapproving attention of the Catholic church in Rome. Pope Urban VIII quickly blocked the sale of the book and initiated an investigation. Galileo was brought to trial before the Roman Inquisition, a department of the Catholic Church responsible for defending Catholic doctrine, faith and morals. Galileo was convicted of heresy for two beliefs: his scientific conclusion that Earth moves around the Sun and his theological view that the Church’s interpretation of Holy Scripture is not the final word on matters of science. (The Catholic Church today does not consider either of these to be heresy.)
Galileo’s \booktitle{Two World Systems} was banned, and he was forced to read an abjuration renouncing his views.
Galileo’s sentence of indefinite imprisonment was commuted to house arrest at his home near Florence.

Although banned, Galileo’s compelling and entertaining case for the heliocentric model spread quickly. His \booktitle{Two World Systems} and other works were widely distributed among astronomers and philosophers beyond the reach of the Roman Catholic Church.

By the end of 1633, Galileo had returned to his villa near Florence where he would spend his remaining years under house arrest.
No longer allowed to write or speak about the heliocentric universe, he resumed his early work on engineering and motion. % that he had started as a professor at the Universities of Pisa and Padua.
He published a book on these topics, \booktitle{Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences}, in 1638. \booktitle{Two New Sciences} launched a revolution in physics every bit as profound as the revolution in astronomy. %In fact, his work on motion applied to the motion of planets and moons in the Solar System, even though he does not mention these objects in \booktitle{Two New Sciences}.

%In \booktitle{Two New Sciences}, Galileo describes the motion of objects on Earth, but he recognized that the same insights could be applied to the circular paths of objects in the Solar System. In fact, the topic of uniform motion is discussed in his \booktitle{Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems} as well.

In \booktitle{Two New Sciences}, Galileo describes \quotation{a new science of motion,} giving more detail and mathematical rigor to the insights originally described in \booktitle{Two World Systems}. Compound motion, like that of the rock dropped from the tower, appears again in \booktitle{Two New Sciences}.% the character Salviati describes projectile motion.%, which is composed of both horizontal and vertical motion under the constant force of gravity.
\startblockquote
	{\sc Salv.} Imagine any particle projected along a horizontal plane without friction. Then we know, from what has been more fully explained in the preceding pages, that this particle will move along this same plane with a motion that is uniform and perpetual, provided the plane has no limits. But if the plane is limited and elevated, then the moving particle, which we imagine to be a heavy body, will on passing over the edge of the plane acquire, in addition to its previous uniform and enduring motion, a downward propensity due to its own weight; and so the resulting motion, which I call projection, is compounded of one that is uniform and horizontal and another that is downward and naturally accelerated.\autocite{p.~357}{Galileo1638}
\stopblockquote

A ball rolling off an elevated plane displays projectile motion in figure \in[fig:BallOffTable]. Two meter sticks, one horizontal and one vertical, measure the ball’s horizontal and vertical positions as it falls. %Salviati does not give the height of the elevated plane or the speed of the particle. I placed the elevated plane $45\units{cm}$ above the ground and gave the ball an initial velocity of $1.20\units{m/s}$.

The mathematical description of the ball’s compound motion is very similar to our earlier description of one dimensional motion, but now there are two positions, horizontal and vertical, rather than one. The ball’s horizontal position, represented by $x$, and the vertical position, $y$, are shown in table \in[T:BallOffTable], starting at $t=0.00\units{s}$ when the ball reaches the edge of the elevated plane. The two positions $x$ and $y$ are called \keyterm{coordinates}. Check that the coordinates listed in table \in[T:BallOffTable] match the positions shown in figure \in[fig:BallOffTable].

\marginTikZ{}{BallOffTableDisplacement}{The horizontal displacement is $\Delta x=12\units{cm}$ for each step. The vertical displacements, $\Delta y$, become increasingly negative.} % vskip, name, caption


Figure \in[fig:BallOffTableDisplacement] shows the ball’s horizontal and vertical displacements, calculated from the ball's positions. For example, the horizontal displacement during the interval from $t=0.10\units{s}$ to $t=0.20\units{s}$ is
\startformula
	\Delta x = x\sf - x\si = 24\units{cm} - 12\units{cm} = 12\units{cm}.
\stopformula
Similarly, the the vertical displacement during the same interval is
\startformula
	\Delta y = y\sf - y\si = 28\units{cm} - 43\units{cm} = -15\units{cm}.
\stopformula

The ball’s horizontal and vertical displacements can be used to find the ball’s horizontal and vertical velocities, {\txx $v_x$} and $v_y$. %(No subscript is necessary when the motion is restricted to only one dimension.)
Each velocity is computed exactly as in one dimension. The ball’s horizontal motion is uniform, so we use the constant velocity formula to find $v_x$.

The ball's vertical motion is accelerated. To find the vertical velocity at a specific time, we use the instantaneous velocity formula,
\startformula
	v_y = \frac{dy}{dt},

with small changes $dt$ and $dy$.

%Unfortunately, the times listed in the table are far enough apart that the velocity changes significantly with each step.
%However, we can make a good approximation of the velocity by choosing the initial and final times judiciously.

	The best choice of times, from our limited options, is $t\si=0.10\units{s}$ and $t\sf=0.30\units{s}$, equally preceding and following the target time.

\section{Vectors}
The ball's horizontal and vertical velocities can be combined to produce a single velocity vector pointing in the direction of the ball's motion, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:BallOffTableVelComp]. The ball's rightward and downward velocities combine to produce an angled velocity vector pointed to the right and down. %This directional vector is represented by the symbol $\vec{v}$.

To completely describe the velocity vector, we list its \keyterm{components}.

\startformula
	\vec v = \components{v_x,v_y}
\stopformula
The little arrow on $\vec{v}$ indicates that it is a vector with multiple components. Notice the angle brackets used for the velocity vector. A position’s coordinates are in parenthesis, while a vector’s components are in angle brackets. %We will encounter more vectors soon.


\startexample[ex:BallOffTableVel] What is the ball’s velocity $\vec v$ at $t=0.20\units{s}$.
\startsolution
	The velocity’s components, $v_x$ and $v_y$, were found in examples \in[ex:BallOffTableVelx] and \in[ex:BallOffTableVely].	\startformula

\noindent
The velocity vectors in \in{figure}[fig:BallOffTableVelComp] are straight, pointing in the direction of the velocity at each specific time. Velocity vectors do not curve along the path.

Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector, represented by $\vabs{\vec v}$. Since the velocity vector is the hypotenuse of the right triangle in figure \in[fig:BallOffTableVelComp], its magnitude can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
%\highlightbox{
\startformula

%}%\end{shaded}
In this formula for speed, the double bars indicate this is not a simple absolute value – it is a vector’s magnitude, which must be computed by squaring the components, adding those squares, and taking the square root of the sum. The magnitude of any vector can be found this way.% Or calculating the components’ squares’ sum’s square root.

\marginTikZ{}{BallOffTableVelMag}{The velocity vectors are shown for each position. The magnitude of the vectors is the speed. The speed at $0.20\units{s}$ is $2.3\units{m/s}$, calculated in example \in[ex:BallFallSpeed]} % vskip, name, caption

\noindent
Sometimes vectors are labeled using only their length, as in figure \in[fig:BallOffTableVelMag], rather than their components.

There are three important things to notice about the speed calculation. First, calculating a vector’s magnitude in two dimensions is more complicated than calculating in one dimension, where the magnitude is simply the absolute value.
Second, the units should be treated carefully. When a component is squared, the answer’s units are squared units: $(-2.0\units{m/s})^2 = 4.0\units{m^2\!/s^2}$. The parentheses are needed to show that both the number and the units are squared. When the square root is taken in the last step, the units get un-squared, giving units of $\unit{m/s}$ again in the final answer. Third, the components can be negative, but their squares are always positive. The sum is always a sum of these positive squares. The magnitude is therefore always positive.

There is only one vector with a magnitude of zero. It is the \keyterm{zero vector,} written $\vec{0}=\components{0,0}$. The zero vector has no direction, since its length is zero, so it is drawn simply as a dot, not an arrow.

When the motion is confined to only one dimension, there is no need to distinguish between the vector and its one component – they are the same! In more than one dimension we need to distinguish the vector $\vec{v}$ from its components $v_x$ and $v_y$. In this case, a $v$ without any decoration is ambiguous. A $v$ with multiple decorations, like $\vec {v}_x$, is nonsense.

%Figure \in[fig:BallOffTablePath] shows the entire path of the ball, rather than just showing the ball’s position at a few times. The path is drawn as a sequence of tiny displacement arrows, each showing the ball’s displacement during $0.01\units{s}$. As the ball approaches the edge of the elevated plane, the arrows are very short because the ball does not travel far during each $0.01\units{s}$. As the ball falls the speed increases and the arrows get proportionally longer.

%The velocity vectors are always straight and tangent to the path, pointing in the direction of motion. If the small displacements are shown along the path, the speed can be determined. Thus, the velocity vector can be drawn with the correct direction and magnitude, as shown in figure \in[fig:BallOffTablePathSpeed].

% During the first half of this duration, the ball is falling more slowly than it is at $t=0.20\units{s}$. During the second half it is falling faster. These two effects

In three dimensions, the velocity vector has three components, $\vec v = \components{v_x, v_y, v_z}$. Speed is this vector's magnitude.
\startformula
	\vabs{\vec v} = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}

Galileo did not use vectors in his work, because vectors were not developed until the nineteenth century.
They are so incredibly helpful that we will use them every chance we get, allowing us to make precise predictions that Galileo, Newton, and Leibnitz could not.

\section[sec:SHO]{Pendulums and simple harmonic motion}
Galileo’s \booktitle{Two New Sciences} describes one more type of motion that will be extremely useful in the upcoming chapters – the motion of a \keyterm{pendulum}, made by hanging a ball on a string (\in{fig.}[fig:Pendulum]). When the ball swings, it oscillates along an arc. Galileo discovered that the period of a pendulum is surprisingly consistent. In \booktitle{Two New Sciences}, Salviati describes the experiment.

	I took two balls, one of lead and one of cork, the former more than a hundred times heaver than the latter, and suspended them by means of two equal fine threads, each four or five cubits long. %\footnote{About 2.5 meters or about 8 feet.}
	Pulling each ball aside from the perpendicular, I let them go at the same instant, and they, falling along the circumferences of circles having these equal strings for radii, passed beyond the perpendicular and returned along the same path. This free oscillation repeated a hundred times showed clearly that the heavy ball maintains so nearly the period of the light ball that neither in a hundred swings nor even in a thousand will the former anticipate the latter by as much as a single moment, so perfectly do they keep step.\autocite{p.~307}{Galileo1638}
\stopblockquote

Galileo also noted that the pendulum’s period does not depend on the size of the arc through which the pendulum swings.
A pendulum, like the one described above, will swing with the same period whether it swings a centimeter in each direction or twenty centimeters.
(This is only true if the arc's length is considerably shorter than the string's length, which will be the case in our examples.)
The pendulums' consistent periods make them especially easy to use for the motion experiments in \in{Chapter}[ch:Momentum].

Our goal is mathematical model of motion, so we need a quantitative description of a pendulum's motion.  I will use this chapter's mathematical language to describe Galileo's pendulum experiments.
Check that my mathematical description below matches the figures in the margin.
(I do not have Galileo's original data, so these numbers are possible numbers for his experiments.)

In \in{figure}[fig:Pendulum], a meter stick has been placed beneath the pendulum, allowing us to quantify the pendulum's position.
The central point of the pendulum's swinging motion is called the \keyterm{equilibrium point}.
(If the pendulum were not swinging, then it would remain motionless at the equilibrium point.)
In \in{figure}[fig:Pendulum], the equilibrium point is at $x=25\units{cm}$.
The \keyterm{amplitude} of the pendulum's oscillations is the pendulum's maximum distance from the equilibrium point. 
In \in{figure}[fig:Pendulum], the pendulum swings back and forth between $x=5\units{cm}$ and $x=45\units{cm}$.
These points are $20\units{cm}$ to the left and right of the equilibrium point. Therefore, the oscillation's amplitude is $A=20\units{cm}$.

The motion graphs for Galileo's lead and cork pendulums are shown in \in{figures}[fig:PendulumLeadCork].
The equilibrium points are shown by the horizontal gray lines at $x=25\units{cm}$. The pendulums oscillate between $x=15\units{cm}$ and $x=35\units{cm}$, so they have the same amplitude $A=10\units{cm}$. The period is $T=3.14\units{s}$ for both pendulums.

\marginTikZ{}{PendulumLeadCork}{The motion graphs for the lead pendulum and the cork pendulum show oscillations with the same period, about $2.5\units{s}$.} % vskip, name, caption

The motion graphs for Galileo's experiments with different amplitudes are shown in \in{figure}[fig:PendulumLargeSmallA].
One pendulum swings between $x=20\units{cm}$ and $x=30\units{cm}$\dash an amplitude $A=5\units{cm}$.
The other pendulum swings between as $x=5\units{cm}$ and $x=45\units{cm}$\dash an amplitude $A=20\units{cm}$
(This last pendulum's swing is shown in the diagram in \in{figure}[fig:Pendulum].) The period for both pendulums is again $T=3.14\units{s}$.


A pendulum's motion is accelerated motion.
When the pendulum is released, it speeds up as it approaches the center, slows down on the other side, stops momentarily, and then begins accelerating back toward the center.
The pendulum's changing velocity can be seen as the changing slope on the motion graph.
The steepest slope, and therefore highest speed, occurs when the pendulum passes through the equilibrium point. This maximum speed is

\startformula[eq:vmaxT]\pagereference[eq:vmaxT]
	\abs{v}\sub{max} %= \frac{dx}{dt}
		= \frac{2\pi A}{T}.
\stopformula
This maximum speed formula looks just like the speed formula for uniform circular motion (p.~\at[eq:vT]), but with the circle's radius $R$ replaced by the oscillation's amplitude $A$. This maximum speed formula works for any simple harmonic oscillator.

Calculating a pendulum's maximum speed is simple, but there is one pitfall to avoid. Since the ball swings along an arc whose radius is the string’s length, you may be tempted to use the speed formula for uniform circular motion (p.~\at[eq:vT]), with the string’s length for the radius $R$. This would be a mistake, because the motion is not uniform!
The pendulum's motion is simple harmonic. For simple harmonic motion, always use the motion's amplitude $A$ in the maximum speed formula.

The oscillating motion of a pendulum is called \keyterm{simple harmonic motion}, and anything that moves in this manner is called a \keyterm{simple harmonic oscillator}. Simple harmonic oscillators are  common. The musical strings and pipes in \in{Chapter}[ch:Music] are all simple harmonic oscillators, with frequencies much higher than a pendulum’s. Like the pendulum,
good musical instruments oscillate with the same frequency, producing the same pitch, whether played quietly (small amplitude) or loudly (large amplitude).

%For all simple harmonic motion, the period $T$ is the time required for the motion to repeat (\in{figure}[fig:PendulumLeadCork]), and the amplitude $A$ is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium point (\in{figure}[fig:PendulumLargeSmallA]).

\section{Four paths become one}

Galileo's new science of motion – illustrated with projectiles, inclines and pendulums – also provides a language for describing the motion of planets, moons and comets. %Galileo did not mention these, but his readers certainly knew that, without mentioning the heavens, he always wrote about the heavens.
In Galileo's model of the Solar System, planets circle the Sun at constant distance with constant speed (uniform circular motion). This model describes the planets' motions fairly well, and it explains many other observations like the phases of Venus. However, precise measurements of the planets' positions show that Galileo's model is not correct. Galileo probably knew this.

In 1609, one year before Galileo’s \booktitle{Sidereal Messenger}, Johannes Kepler published \booktitle{New Astronomy}.
In \booktitle{New Astronomy}, Kepler describes the planets' orbits using compound motion, combining each planet's motion around the Sun with another oscillating motion that brings the planet closer to the Sun on one side of the orbit and takes the planet farther from the Sun on the other side, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:KeplerCompound]. Kepler sent a copy of \booktitle{New Astronomy} to Galileo, but Galileo did not use Kepler's model in his own writing. Perhaps Galileo did not want to obscure his heliocentric arguments with these technical details. It is also possible that Galileo never read Kepler's enormous and mathematically sophisticated book.

%This motion is more complicated than anything described by Galileo. The planets' motion around the Sun is not uniform. Each planet's angular velocity increases when it is closer to the Sun and decreases when it is farther away. Each planet's motion toward the Sun is not free-fall motion (which would end with planets crashing into the Sun!), nor is it simple harmonic. While Kepler's model can be described using Galileo's language of compound motion, predicting the exact motion will require new tools. We will return to Kepler's model in \in{Chapter}[ch:Rotation], when we have those tools in hand.

Marin Mersenne\pagereference[MersenneString], working in France during the generation after Galileo, applied Galileo's new science of motion to the rapid vibrations of musical instruments. Mersenne had studied the ancient treatises on music and was a trained musician himself. He also studied the recent works of Vincenzo, Kepler, and Galileo, and he adopted their method of mathematical modeling checked against careful observations and experiments.

Mersenne noted a remarkable behavior in the sound of any single string. 
\quotation{The struck or sounded string\dots makes at least five different tones at the same time.}
He further observed,
\quotation{these sounds follow the ratio of these numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,} exactly the ratios that produce the consonances! This raised a confounding question.
\quotation{How is it possible that a single string produces many sounds at the same time?}
Mersenne knew that the frequency of the string's vibration is responsible for the pitch. 
\startblockquote
%The immediate cause of the tones is taken from the number of the vibrations of the air\dots and not from the length of the strings.
That is why it is necessary to examine how [the movement] can cause the same string to beat the air differently in the same time, for since the string makes the five or six tones of which I have spoken, it seems that it is entirely necessary that the string beat the air 5, 4, 3, and 2 times in the same time that it beats a single time. This is difficult to imagine\dots."
\autocite{pp..~267-269}{Mersenne1636}
\stopblockquote
Mersenne seems to have discovered another example of compound motion, combining five or six different motions simultaneously, each with different frequencies, all in perfect, simple ratios. This is indeed difficult to imagine — so difficult that it confounded the best physicists and mathematicians for nearly two centuries! Understanding the musical string's compound motion is the key to understanding the ancient Pythagorean model of musical consonance (\at{p.}[fig:Pythagoras]).
Mersenne will join us again in \in{Chapter}[ch:Waves], when our model of motion is finally capable of describing the musical string's complex dance.

%Astronomers study the planetary motions over vast expanses of time and space.
Galileo demonstrated that slow and vast planetary motions could be understood by studying simple objects' motions in laboratory experiments.
Mersenne did the same for the tiny, rapid motions of musical instruments.
They thus merged the four paths of the quadrivium into one path: the study of motion.
This convergence is already happening in your imagined world, too. You have begun relating the arithmetic ideas in formulas to the geometric shapes in diagrams and motion graphs. You have begun describing astronomical obits and musical oscillations in the same mathematical language of frequency, position, displacement, and velocity. In the last two chapters, you have begun to speak the mathematical language of motion developed by natural philosophers over two-thousand years.
You may not have mastered this language, but you will become fluent as we use it to discuss further revisions of our model of motion.
Kepler, Galileo, and Mersenne took the first steps on this path.
We will follow the path to its destination — a universal, mathematical model of motion capable of explaining the motions of astronomy, music, and everything in between.

%Galileo remained active in research and mentored students at his villa until his death in 1642 at the age of 77. 
%Following Galileo, many natural philosophers sought to quantify the amount of motion in an object. Several interesting ideas emerged, leading to a decades-long feud known as the \visviva\ debate.
%In the next two chapters, we will explore these ideas, navigate through the debate, and arrive at an unexpected resolution.

\question In 1967, Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish discovered a star that flashed brightly every $1.33\units{s}$. Eventually, pulsing stars like this became known as pulsars. Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars which shine bright beams of light out of their magnetic poles. We see a flash every time one of the spinning pulsar’s beams points in our direction. What is this pulsar’s frequency?

\question In 1968 another pulsar was discovered in the nearby Crab Nebula with a period of only $33\units{ms}$. What is this pulsar’s frequency?

\question On August 17, 2017, an extremely sensitive device known as \scaps{ligo} (Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory) detected a tiny vibration of space-time. These vibrations were gravitational waves from a pair of orbiting neutron stars which revealed the stars’ orbital frequency to be $20\units{Hz}$. What was the orbital period of these two stars? (This ferocious dance did not last long. Over the next thirty seconds the neutron stars spiraled into each other, producing an enormous explosion. The merged stars then collapsed to form a black hole. Luckily, this violent event happened very, very far from us.)
