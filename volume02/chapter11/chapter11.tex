\Initial{W}{hen Thomas Newcomen} and his partner John Calley built the first piston steam engine 1712, there was not a physicist alive who could have explained how it worked. Newcomen and Calley built the engine to pump water out of a mine at the Conygree Coalworks in central England. At the time, there were no powered machines working in the mines – all work was done by laborers and horses. The mine did have a sort of steam pump that used condensing steam to suck ground water out of the mine, preventing the mine from flooding. However, this steam pump was not working and Newcomen was called to fix it. The fix he devised, shown in \in{figure}[fig:NewcomenAtmospheric], was actually an entirely new design. \in{Figure}[fig:NewcomenAtmospheric] shows his new engine in its resting position. On the left is a simple pump driven by a large weight. When the weight is lifted, water flows into the bottom of the pump, deep in the mine (not shown). When the heavy weight is lowered, it forces water up a pipe to the surface. Then the weight must be lifted again. 

\placefigure[margin][fig:NewcomenAtmospheric]{Newcomen engine from \booktitle{Practical physics for secondary schools. Fundamental principles and applications to daily life,} by Newton Henry Black and Harvey Nathaniel Davis, publ. 1913 by Macmillan and Company, p.~219} {\externalfigure[NewcomenAtmospheric][width=\rightmarginwidth]}

Lifting the weight is the job of the engine on the right. Water in the boiler $A$ is heated by a fire below. When the valves $V$ and $V''$ are opened (with valve $V'$ closed), steam rises into the cylinder $B$ forcing any air out through the valve $V''$.

Once the cylinder is filled entirely with steam, the cylinder is sealed by closing valves $V$ and $V''$. Then the valve $V'$ is opened briefly, allowing cold water from the tank $C$ to spray into the cylinder, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:NewcomenAtmospheric]. This spray cools the cylinder and the steam, causing the steam to condense into liquid water again. All of the steam condenses into a tiny volume of water, which collects with the sprayed water at the bottom of the cylinder. No air is allowed back into the cylinder, and all of the steam has condensed, so the cylinder is almost empty, with near vacuum above the small pool of  water at the bottom.

Outside the cylinder is the atmosphere, pushing in from all sides. Most importantly, the atmosphere pushes down on the movable piston which forms the top of the cylinder in \in{figure}[fig:NewcomenAtmospheric]. The downward pressure $P$ produces a huge downward force $F$ on the piston.
\startformula
	F = PA,
\stopformula
where $A$ is the piston's area. (In this chapter we will use $P$ for pressure, not power.) The {\sc si} unit for pressure is a pascal, defined by
\startformula
	1\units{Pa} = 1\units{N/m^2}.
\stopformula
%Atmospheric pressure is about $P\sub{atm} = 101\units{kPa} = 1.01\sci{5}\units{Pa}$, but it varies significantly with altitude and weather.

\startexample[ex:NewcomenForce]
A working replica of Newcomen's engine operates at a museum near the site of Newcomen's original. The piston's radius is $26\units{cm}$. What is the force exerted on the piston by the atmosphere?

\startsolution
The piston's area is $A= \pi r^2 = \pi(0.26m)^2 = 0.212\units{m^2}$. The force is
\startformula\startmathalignment
\NC F	\NC = PA												\NR
\NC		\NC = (1.01\sci{5}\units{Pa})(0.212\units{m^2})				\NR

\NC		\NC = 21\,000\units{N}.
\stopmathalignment\stopformula
This downward force acting on the right side of \in{figure}[fig:NewcomenAtmospheric] is enough to lift a weight of over $2000\units{kg}$ on the left.
\stopsolution

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The atmosphere's pressure drives the piston downward. This downward motion is the engine's power stroke. It pulls down on the chain at $D$ in \in{figure}[fig:NewcomenAtmospheric], rocking the large lever $FED$ around the pivot $E$. That lifts the chain at $F$, raising the large weight.

Once the weight is lifted, the valve $V$ is opened, allowing the water to flow down into the boiler. Hot steam from the boiler fills the cylinder $B$ again, allowing the piston to rise and the weight to fall.
The whole process is then be repeated, spraying cold water into the cylinder to condense the steam for the power stroke. (Since the cylinder is filling with steam directly from the boiler, valve $V''$ does not need to be opened each cycle.)

Newcomen's design included mechanisms that used the motion of the top beam to open and close the valves automatically at precisely the right times in the cycle. (These mechanisms are not shown in the diagrams.) This allowed the engine to operate continuously, performing each cycle in about five seconds and doing as much work as a team of several horses or dozens of men. Many mines upgraded to Newcomen's reliable and powerful engine. Dozens were installed in Britain and eventually in other parts of Europe.

The engines could be built in a variety of sizes, depending on the mine's needs. Engineers developed the concepts of work and power to quantify their engines' productivity, so they could build the right size engine.

\startexample[ex:NewcomenPower]
The replica of Newcomen's engine in \in{example}[ex:NewcomenForce] has a piston that travels approximately 1.8\units{m} inside the cylinder, shown in \in{figure}[fig:NewcomenPower]. Like Newcomen's original, it operates at a rate of one cycle every five seconds. Find the work done by the atmosphere on the engine and the average power.

\startsolution
The work can be calculated using the force form \in{example}[ex:NewcomenForce] and a displacement of 1.8\units{m}.
\startformula
W = F\Delta y
	= (21\,000\sci{4}\units{N})(1.8\units{m})	
	= 38\,000\units{J}.
\stopformula
The force and displacement are in the same direction, so the work is positive. In \in{figure}[fig:NewcomenPower] they are both pointed in the negative direction, so we also could have written both as negative. The answer would be the same.

Power is the rate at which the work is done.
\startformula
	\frac{W}{\Delta t} = \frac{38\,000\units{J}.}{5\units{s}} = 7500\units{W}
\stopformula
\stopsolution
\stopexample
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

While we used the piston's area and displacement to calculate the work, all that is actually needed is the pressure and the cylinder's change in volume. The volume of the cylinder in \in{figure}[fig:NewcomenPower] is $V = Ay$, where $A$ is the piston's area and $y$ is its height. Taking care with signs, we should write the downward force as $F=-PA$, since pressure and area are positive, but the force is in the negative direction.
\startformula
	W = F \Delta y = -P A(y\sf - y\si) = -P(Ay\sf - Ay\si) = -P(V\sf - V\si) = -P\Delta V
\stopformula
The negative sign deserves some explanation. During the engine's downward power stroke, the volume inside the cylinder is decreasing, so $\Delta V$ is negative. The pressure is positive, so the work formula $W= -P\Delta V$ will give positive work for the downward power stroke, as it should.

Work was a new concept to physicists in the eighteenth century – remember, the \visviva\ debate was raging at this time – but the ideas behind the engine's forceful power stroke were well understood. Atmospheric pressure, force, and displacement were all basic physics knowledge at that time.

However, physicists could not explain the engine's upward stroke. The piston is lifted by the heavy weight's descent, but this is only possible because steam is allowed into the cylinder, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:NewcomenSteam]. The steam, also at atmospheric pressure, pushes up on the bottom of the piston, balancing the downward force of the outside atmosphere so the piston can rise. The steam is clearly doing work as it lifts the piston against the downward force of the atmosphere, but where does the steam get the energy? Clearly, the energy is from the fire, but it is not obvious how the energy of the fire turns into work done on the piston.

\section{Molecules hold the heat}
Daniel Bernoulli's \booktitle{Hydrodynamica} appeared in 1738. In this great work, he brought together physicists' \visviva, engineers' work, and his own ideas about potential energy. He also offered an insightful and correct model of gases like steam. He described the gas as being made of many tiny parts, now called molecules, that bounce around furiously – ricocheting off of the container's walls and off of each other, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:DBernoulliGas]. In this model, the tiny molecules are spread throughout the mostly empty space inside the container. It looks as if the piston and the weight at the top of \in{figure}[fig:DBernoulliGas] will fall, packing the molecules together at the bottom of the cylinder. Bernoulli realized that if the molecules are traveling fast enough, their repeated impacts on the bottom of the piston will provide enough tiny impulses to keep the piston from falling. This became known as the \keyterm{kinetic theory of gasses} because the molecules' motion causes the pressure. The molecules' sizes and shapes are of little consequence.
\placefigure[margin][fig:DBernoulliGas]{Daniel Bernoulli's description of a gas. The gas molecules are not packed together. Still, their frequent collisions with the piston hold the piston and weight aloft.\autocite{p.226}{DBernoulli1968}} {\externalfigure[DBernoulliGas][width=\rightmarginwidth]}

Bernoulli took several important steps in developing this model. He recognized that work done by the piston would increase the molecules' kinetic energy. He also recognized that heat in the gas is actually the molecules' kinetic energy. This established a connection between work and heat which would eventually be central to understanding engines. Unfortunately, this part of \booktitle{Hydrodynamica} was largely ignored for a century. Physicists were not interested in engines, and engineers were not reading physics treatises. It was a great century for steam engines, but not a great century for understanding the heat that powered them.

By the early nineteenth century, physicists noticed the industrial revolution happening around them. Many physicists decided to catch up with the engineers by investigating the connection between energy and temperature. They found that the connection depended on the material being studied. Heating water over a fire to a certain temperature takes far longer than heating an equal mass of copper, for example. We say that water has a very high \keyterm{heat capacity} because it consumes a great deal of heat for a relatively small increase in temperature and gives off a great deal of heat when its temperature decreases. 

In 1819 at the École Polytechnique in Paris, Pierre Dulong and Alexis Petit were measuring the heat capacities of solid elements (a dozen metals and sulfur) when they noticed a surprising chemistry connection, which they stated as a new law.  

\startblockquote
The atoms of all simple bodies [elements] have exactly the same heat capacity.\autocite{p.395}{DulongPetit1819}
\stopblockquote

The \keyterm{Delong-Petit Law} applies only to \emph{solid} elements, not gasses or liquids.
The Delong-Petit Law works especially well for the many elements that are metals, and it explains why lighter metals have a higher heat capacity than heavier metals: Lighter metals have more atoms in the same mass, so they hold more thermal energy.

%[remove?]
%
%The energy required to raise the temperature of most solid elements was proportional to the amount of substance measured in moles! Moles were a fairly new idea, and the molar masses of many elements were not yet known. (In fact, a great many elements had not yet been identified.)
%
%In modern notation it says that the energy in random thermal motions $E\sth$ is proportional to the temperature $T$ and the number of moles $n$.
%\startformula
%	E\sth = 3nRT
%\stopformula
%The constant $R = 8.314\units{J/mol\.K}$. 
%
%
%If you have taken chemistry, you might have noticed the $nRT$ on the right side of the Delong-Petit Law looks a lot like the right side of the Ideal Gas Law. This is an important connection that should become clear by the end of the chapter. If you did not notice that connection, you are in good company. Delong and Petit did not notice it either because the Ideal Gas Law had not been discovered. Delong and Petit's discovery preceded the Ideal Gas Law by several decades.
%
%The Delong-Petit Law gives us a formula for thermal energy that we can use with conservation of energy. Thermal energy can be combined with any of the other forms of energy – kinetic energy, or various types of potential energy – but for simple heating experiments $E\sth$ is the only type of energy that matters. Solids do not expand dramatically when heated, so the work due to $\Delta V$ is tiny compared to the heat, and can be ignored.

Dulong and Petit's discovery proved incredibly useful. Chemists had been trying to determine molar masses using chemical reactions. This presented a challenge, because the chemists could not be sure of the chemical formulas, so they often did not know if one mole of a compound in their reactions included one mole, two moles, or more moles of the individual elements. This could lead to huge errors in the molar mass. However, the Dulong-Petit Law, while not incredibly precise, allowed a determination of the number of moles in a sample purely from physical measurements, without any chemical reactions. This method corrected many of the chemists' early mistakes.

Delong and Petit's original paper looked at only 13 solid elements, but eventually their law was used for dozens of elements. The molar masses checked using the Delong-Petit law were central to the construction of the periodic table in 1871.

For physicists, the Dulong-Petit Law established a clear connection between atoms, temperature, and thermal energy. Somehow, atoms hold thermal energy, probably in their microscopic random motions, but the details were unresolved. The law could not be extended to liquids and gasses in engines like Newcomen's.

\section{The motion which we call heat}
Rudolf Clausius finally made the connection between energy, heat, and work. His equation relating them is the equation we have called conservation of energy. He was the one who put it all together.
\startformula
	H\si + W + Q = H\sf
\stopformula
This equation is often called the \keyterm{First Law of Thermodynamics}, especially when used in problems involving thermal energy and heat, but it is the conservation of energy law you already know. The full equation is especially important for studying gasses, where heat and work both affect the energy.

Clausius also provided the first full accounting of the kinetic theory of gasses proposed by Daniel Bernoulli over a century earlier. Clausius' 1857 paper \booktitle{On The Nature of the Motion We Call Heat} connects pressure and temperature with the microscopic kinetic energy of gas molecules.
Clausius followed Bernoulli's suggestion, considering a container of volume $V$ (\in{fig.}[fig:DBernoulliGas]) containing many molecules, each with mass $m$ and speed $v$, bouncing around in all directions.
By carefully calculating the impulse delivered to the lid by the colliding molecules, as well as the frequency of these collisions, Clausius found the pressure $P$ exerted on the lid by the gas.
\startformula
	P = \frac{Nmv^2}{3V},
\stopformula
where $N$ is the large number of molecules in the gas. The molecules' kinetic energy $K=\onehalf\,mv^2$ can be found by solving the equation above for $mv^2$. 
\startformula
  K = \frac{3PV}{2N}
\stopformula
In a real gas, every molecule does not have exactly the same kinetic energy. This formula for the kinetic energy $K$ gives the molecules' average kinetic energy.

At this point, Clausius goes beyond Bernoulli's idea by using the \keyterm{ideal gas law.}
\startformula
PV = nRT
\stopformula
The terms on the right side of the ideal gas law – the number of moles $n$, the absolute temperature $T$, and the gas constant $R$ – were each found after Bernoulli's time. Clausius uses the ideal gas law to replace $PV$ in the kinetic energy equation above with $nRT$, producing a direct relationship between the molecules' average kinetic energy and the temperature.
\startformula
  K = \frac{3nRT}{2N}
\stopformula
The number of molecules is the number of moles times Avogadro's Number, i.~e. $N=n\NA$.
\startformula
  K = \frac{3nRT}{2n\NA} = \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{R}{\NA}\right) T
\stopformula
The constant $\kB$ has been introduced to replace $R/\NA$. (More on this constant in the next section.) In modern notation, the molecules' average kinetic energy is
\startformula
  K\sub{trans} = \textfrac{3}{2}\,\kB T.
\stopformula
I have labeled the kinetic energy as specifically the \emph{translational} kinetic energy, because this is what Clausius calculated. Clausius tells us the actual thermal energy in a gas, determined through experiments, is approximately
\startformula
	E\sub{molecule} \approx 2.4\,\kB T.
\stopformula
This larger value includes other types of energy – rotational kinetic energy or energy of vibrations within the molecule – which would make $E\sub{molecule}$ greater than $K\sub{trans}$.
\startblockquote
The kinetic energy of the translatory motion does not alone represent the whole quantity of heat in the gas.... We must conclude, therefore, that besides the translatory motion of the molecules as such, the constituents of these molecules perform other motions, whose kinetic energy also forms a part of the contained quantity of heat.\autocite{p.108. \emph{vis viva} replaced with \emph{kinetic energy}}{Clausius1857}
\stopblockquote

Clasius' result for the energy in a gas can be directly compared to the Dulong-Petit Law. In the same modern notation, the Dulong-Petit Law gives a very similar formula for the thermal energy of atoms in a solid.
\startformula
	E\sub{atom} = 3\,\kB T.
\stopformula
We now have three very similar formulas for thermal energy in terms of temperature.

\noindent
In all cases, the energy is proportional to the temperature.  The only difference is the coefficient on the right, which seems to be related to the state: $3$ for solids and approximately $2.4$ for common gasses. This difference is not surprising, since the molecules in a solid will likely have different motions than molecules in a gas.

\section{Boltzmann's equipartition theorem}

In 1860, the brilliant physicist James Clerk Maxwell decided to determine the coefficient in the $E\sub{molecule}$ formula for common gasses by carefully accounting for all the types of motion available to the molecule. It was a disaster.

Maxwell derived one very important result in his first attempt: every possible type of motion contributes $\onehalf\,\kB T$ of kinetic energy. (He called each possible type of motion a \quotation{degree of freedom.}) The simple gas molecules considered by Clausius have three degrees of freedom: motion in the $x$-direction, the $y$-direction, and the $z$-direction. The kinetic energies $K_x$, $K_y$, and $K_z$ due to these motions each contain an average of $\onehalf\,\kB T$ of energy.
The average translational kinetic energy $K\sub{trans}$ of a molecule is the sum of the energy due to the molecule's motion in each of the three directions.
\startformula
  K\sub{trans} = K_x + K_y + K_z
    = \half\,\kB T + \half\,\kB T + \half\,\kB T
    = \textfrac{3}{2}\,\kB T
\stopformula
Since every degree of freedom has the same average energy, the all that remained for Maxwell was to count the degrees of freedom.

The simplest possibility is that the molecules' only degrees of freedom are translations in the $x$, $y$, and $z$-directions, which gives Clausius' total $K\sub{trans}$, which we already saw was too small. Maxwell therefore considered the possibility that the molecules have some rigid shape and can rotate about the three coordinate axes. These three types of rotation provide another three degrees of freedom, for a total of $3+3=6$ degrees of freedom per molecule. The total thermal energy in the gas would be
\startplaceformula[title={wrong}]
\startformula
	E\sub{molecule} = 6\cdot\half\, \kB T
		= 3\kB T
\stopformula
\stopplaceformula
This is the Dulong-Petit Law for solids, not the thermal energy in a common gas. Maxwell admitted that this attempt was a failure.

The next advance came ten years later, in 1971, when Ludwig Boltzmann discovered that thermal energy also goes into potential energy, not just kinetic energy. If the atoms are held together by forces similar to a spring, which is plausible, then every spring will also contain an average potential energy equal to the average kinetic energy in each degree of freedom. To find the total energy requires counting the degrees of freedom plus the number of springs. This is called the \keyterm{equipartition theorem}, because it says that the energy is divided (partitioned) equally among all of the degrees of freedom and springs, on average.

Maxwell tried again, including degrees of freedom and springs. Common gasses are made of two atoms: \chemical{N_2}, \chemical{O_2}, \chemical{H_2}, \chemical{NO}, etc. If the atoms are connected by a spring, then each atom has three degrees of freedom for its motion, plus one spring, for a total of $3+3+1=7$ places to put energy in each molecule. Each molecule's total thermal energy would be
\startplaceformula[title={wrong}]
\startformula
	E\sub{molecule} = 7 \cdot \half\, \kB T
		= \textfrac{7}{2}\, \kB T
\stopformula
\stopplaceformula
This is even worse than the previous attempt! Most concerning, Maxwell saw a disturbing pattern. In 1875, he sounded the alarm.
\startblockquote
Now, every additional variable [degree of freedom] introduces an additional amount of capacity for internal motion\dots. Every additional variable, therefore, increases the heat capacity\dots. So does any capacity which the molecule may have for storing up energy in the potential form. But the calculated heat capacity is already too great when we suppose the molecule to consist of two atoms only. Hence every additional degree of complexity which we attribute to the molecule can only increase the difficulty of reconciling the observed with the calculated value of the  heat capacity.	

I have now put before you what I consider to be the greatest difficulty yet encountered by the molecular theory.\autocite{p.375. \emph{specific heat} replaced with \emph{heat capacity}. p.433}{Maxwell1875}

Maxwell's admonition led to two breakthroughs – one experimental and one theoretical. Experimentalists, wishing to minimize the confounding degrees of freedom, turned their attention to monoatomic gasses. Not many were know in 1875, since none of the noble gasses had been discovered. Mercury vapor, which consists of individual mercury atoms, was found to have a thermal energy 
\startplaceformula[title={monoatomic gas}]
\startformula
	E\sub{atom} = \textfrac{3}{2}\,nRT.
\stopformula
\stopplaceformula
This is exactly what is predicted for an atom that only has three degrees of freedom – no spinning, vibrating, or springs.
This was an important success for the equipartition theorem and for molecular theory, although a rather simple success.

The theoretical advance came again from Boltzmann, this time in his important 1876 paper \booktitle{On the Nature of Gas Molecules}. After recalling the success of Mercury vapor with three degrees of freedom, he continues carefully.
\startblockquote
It is now obvious to consider the case that a molecule consists of two firmly connected [atoms]. Such a molecule would have five degrees of freedom; the three coordinates of its center of gravity and two variables that determine the direction of its central line\dots. 
\stopblockquote
Maxwell had over counted. Only two angles are needed to describe the direction of the central line, giving two rotational degrees of freedom. Along with the three degrees of freedom for the molecules position, this gives $3+2=5$ degrees of freedom for each molecule, leading to

\startformula
	E\sub{molecule} = \textfrac{5}{2}\,\kB T. \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad
\stopformula
\stopplaceformula
Compared to the experimental coefficient of $2.4$, Boltzmann concludes that his predicted coefficient of $5/2$ is
\startblockquote
\dots a value which dos not deviate too far from that experimentally found for air and most other simple gasses. The same value would be obtained if a molecule consisted of any series of firmly connected [atoms] which lie in a straight line.
\stopblockquote
Carbon dioxide, which has the linear structure O–C–O, is an example of a linear molecule with five degrees of freedom.
\startblockquote
On the other hand, if [the] atoms are not in a straight line or more generally if the molecule is any rigid shape which is not [linear] then the number of degrees of freedom is six\dots.
\stopblockquote
This leads to the thermal energy that Maxwell had mistakenly applied to all molecular gasses.

another important success. It is remarkable that we can learn about the shape of a gas molecule by carefully measuring the heat capacity of the gas. The shape of the molecule – linear or nonlinear – determines the number of degrees of freedom, and therefore determines how much thermal energy each molecule will hold!

Finally, having explained the nature of gas molecules, Boltzmann turned his attention to the elemental solids described by the Delong-Petit Law half a century earlier. In the solid, an atom can move slightly in all three directions, but it cannot move far. It has three degrees of freedom, but it is also pushed back toward its equilibrium positions by the spring-like forces exerted along each direction by neighboring atoms. These forces act effectively as three springs, one along each degree of freedom, restoring the atom to its proper place. Three degrees of freedom and three springs give $3+3=6$ spots to put energy for each atom, leading to the Dulong-Petit Law.

Boltzmann's 1876 paper was a tremendous triumph for his equipartition theorem and for molecular theory.


\section{Boltzmann's constant}
In 1876, Avogadro's number was not known. At the beginning of the twentieth century, when the value was found to be $\NA = 6.02\sci{23}\unit{/mol}$, the quantity $\kB$ became known as Boltzmann's constant.
\startformula
	\kB = \frac{R}{\NA} =  1.381\sci{-23}\units{ J/K}
\stopformula
According to Boltzmann's equipartition theorem, the average amount of energy stored in each place (degree of freedom or spring) is proportional to the temperature, and is given by the formula $½\,\kB T$. 

You should think of $\kB$ as a conversion from kelvins to joules. Kelvins are just another unit for measuring average energy. Specifically, a kelvin is a measure of the energy in each place. A kelvin is a very tiny amount of energy, because at a temperature of $1\units{K}$ the energy in each place is extremely tiny. Even at room temperature $T = 298\units{K}$ the energy in each place is tiny. It is only the energy of many, many molecules that is significant.

In 2019, the Standard International units were updated to make Boltzmann's constant the definition of temperature, and Boltzmann's constant was assigned the exact value
\startplaceformula[title={exact}]
\startformula
	\kB =  1.380649\sci{-23}\units{ J/K}.
\stopformula
\stopplaceformula
Likewise, Avogadro's number was made the definition of a mole, with the defined value 
\startplaceformula[title={exact}]
\startformula
	\NA =  6.02214076\sci{-23}\unit{ /mol}.
\stopformula
\stopplaceformula
This leads to an exact value for the Gas constant $R$.
\startplaceformula[title={exact}]
\startformula
	R = \kB\NA = 8.31446261815324\unit{ J/mol\.K}
\stopformula
\stopplaceformula
Usually, these exact values are not needed for calculations. What is important to remember is that \emph{temperature is a measure of energy.}
