%$6.241509\sci{18}$ electrons is \emph{negative} one Coulomb. One Coulomb of charge from a one volt battery gives one joule of energy. How many electron volts are in one joule? Converting the other way, one electron volt is how many joules? How many electron volts of energy would be produced by one mole of electrons going through a potential difference on one volt. How many joules? Calories too?
