Some harder problems using Lagrange's force formula and Hamilton's momentum formula.

\startexample[ex:MassPulleyLagrange]
A small mass $m=\unit{20g}$ hangs by a string from a heavy pulley of radius $R=\unit{2cm}$, as shown in \in{figure}[fig:MassPulley]. Rotating the pulley counterclockwise through an angle $\theta$ raise the mass $m$ to a height $h=R\theta$.
Use Lagrange's force formula to find the torque exerted by gravity on the system.

\startsolution
For Lagrange's force formula, we need a formula for the system's potential energy. The potential energy of the pulley does not matter, because it is constant as the pulley rotates. We only need the changing potential energy of the small mass, which is $U=mgh=mgR\theta$.
\startformula
  F_\theta = -\ppth U
    = -\ppth mgR\theta
    = -mgR
    = \unit{-00.0 kg m^2/s^2}
\stopformula
This torque is in the negative $\theta$ direction. Since $\theta$ is the counterclockwise angle, the torque due to gravity will try to spin the pulley in the clockwise direction.

\startexample[ex:MassPulleyHamilton]
A small mass hangs by a string from a heavy pulley. The small mass is The pulley's mass is $M$ and the its radius is $R$.
Spinning the pulley clockwise with angular velocity $\omega$ raises the mass upward with velocity $v = R\omega$.
Use Hamilton's momentum formula to find the angular momentum of the system.
\startsolution
Spinning the pulley gives kinetic energy to both the pulley and the mass.
The system's kinetic energy is
\startformula
  K = \half I\omega^2 + \half mv^2
    = \half I\omega^2 + \half mR^2\omega^2
\stopformula
Now that we have the kinetic energy, we can use Hamilton's 
\startformula
  p_\theta = \ppom K
    = -\ppth mgR\theta
    = -mgR
\stopformula
This torque is in the negative $\theta$ direction. Since $\theta$ is the counterclockwise angle, the torque due to gravity will try to spin the pulley in the clockwise direction.

We must take a moment to understand what such an ambitious general solution would mean. It is hard enough to solve one problem at a time. How could Lagrange address every conceivable problem at once?

First, we must understand the goal of a general solution, which is to predict the system's motion. This is accomplished when we know the position coordinates ($x$, $y$, $\theta$, etc.) for every part of the system at every time. For example, we would like to know the position of a cannon ball at every time between when it is fired upward at an angle and when it hits the ground. Galileo gave us the first tool that we need to accomplish this, the position update formulas.

\stopformula
Starting from the cannon ball's initial coordinates, we can use the cannon ball's velocity to find its location a short time later. These position updates are shown in \in{figure}[fig:cannonEoMxy]. The process is repeated over and over to find the position at any time, provided we know the velocity at each moment. However, knowing the velocity is a problem. Galileo studied important examples that have a known velocity – uniform motion, free fall, and simple harmonic motion – but this is far from a general method.

Descartes pointed the way forward with his idea for a conserved quantity of motion. His formula did not work, but two later ideas succeeded. The first was Newton's momentum, updated using his second law. The momentum update formulas for the cannon ball are
\startformula
	dp_x = 0,
	\qquad
	dp_y = -mg\,dt.
\stopformula
The momentum's $x$-component is constant, so its change is always zero. The momentum's $y$-component changes at a constant rate in the downward direction, so its change is always the same size and negative.
These momentum updates are shown in \in{figure}[fig:cannonEoMp].
The updates are all proportional to the small duration $dt$ of our time steps.
%We start with the cannon ball's initial momentum and update it repeatedly to find the momentum at any later time. The momentum gives us the velocity we need to update the position.
Putting this together with Galileo's position update formulas gives the cannon ball's \keyterm{equations of motion}.

\NC dy	\NC = \frac{p_y}{m}\,dt	\NC dp_y	\NC = -mg\,dt	\NR
\stopalign\stopformula
Equations of motion must provide a formula to update each coordinate and each momentum. For the two dimensional motion of the cannon ball we must have four update formulas. The right side of the formulas can include known constants (like $m$ and $g$) and the current coordinates and momenta. For the cannon ball's equations of motion, we see that the momentum update formulas contain only constants, and the position update formulas contain constants and momentum components. (I replaced the velocity components with their momentum equivalents.) These are good equations of motion.
%In the words of Lagrange, these are good equations of motion because they are \quotation{all of the necessary equations for the solution of [the] problem."

Once we have the equations of motion, we must solve them. For the cannon ball, we start with the cannon ball's initial position and momentum, and then use the update formulas over and over to find the position and momentum at any later time. Sometimes the equations of motion are easy to solve. The equation for $p_x$ is easy to solve. Since the updates are always zero, we know that the momentum's  $x$-component at every time is the same as its initial value (\in{fig.}[fig:cannonEoMp]). Sometimes the equations of motion can be solved with more advanced mathematical tools. In many cases, the equations of motion can only be solved through the tedious process of repeated calculation for many, many small time steps. Today, these repetitive calculation are performed rapidly by computers – once they are given the system's equations of motion.

For the cannon ball, and many other simple systems, Newton's method produces the equations of motion quite easily. However, Newton's approach is not well suited to the two quadrivium problems we hope to solve: the planets' compound motion discovered by Kepler and the musical string's compound vibrations discovered by Mersenne. The quadrivium problems are much easier to approach using the second successful quantity of motion, kinetic energy.

We have already seen how rotational kinetic energy allows us to study spinning or rolling motion, where many connected parts move with different velocities but share a common angular motion. Angular coordinates are also the natural coordinates for planetary motions. We will use angular coordinates and rotational kinetic energy to find and solve the planets' equations of motion in \in{Chapter}[ch:Rotation]. Like a spinning object, a musical string has many parts moving with different velocities. The string's motion is best described in terms of shared motions rather than the individual parts' motions. We will use the shared motion's energy to find and solve the string's equations of motion in \in{Chapter}[ch:Waves]. Before we attack those problems, we must find a connection between the energy and equations of motion.

Energy is not directional, so it works very well for systems with parts moving in many directions, (like spinning and rolling) and in situations where the coordinates are not straight (like angular coordinates). Perhaps kinetic energy could provide the velocities we need for Galileo's position update formulas.

Unfortunately, kinetic energy is not enough. Since kinetic energy is not directional, it cannot give us the velocity components needed for the position update formulas. In the case of the cannon ball, we can easily use conservation of energy to find the cannon ball's speed at any height, but conservation of energy cannot tell us the velocity's direction, which we need to correctly update the position. (In one dimension, where velocity has only one component, kinetic energy is often enough, but we will not use this one-dimensional trick.)

If there are more coordinates, like $y$ for the cannon ball, then there are more directions for the virtual displacement. Lagrange found that he could get each component of Newton's force by choosing the correct direction for the virtual displacement. He found the $x$-component of Newton's force with a virtual displacement in the $x$-direction, the $y$-component with a virtual displacement in the $y$-direction, and so on for all the coordinates of the system. (These virtual displacements do not actually happen in the physical system, so Lagrange was free to imagine different virtual displacements to get the force's different components.)

For the cannon ball, a small virtual displacement $\partial x$ in the $x$-direction is a horizontal displacement (shown in \in{figure}[fig:cannondx]), which does not change the cannon ball's gravitational potential energy at all. For this horizontal displacement, $\partial U = 0$. Lagrange's equation gives the $x$-component of the gravitational force. (I will drop \quotation{Newton} from the suffix for the remainder of this section.)
\startformula
	F_{x} = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}
		= -\frac{0}{\partial x}

\stopformula
The gravitational force's $x$-components is zero, as we knew. A small virtual displacement $\partial y$ in the $y$-direction is a vertical displacement (shown in \in{figure}[fig:cannondy]), which does change the cannon ball's gravitational potential energy. For this vertical displacement, $\partial U = mg\partial y$, which leads to the $y$ component of the gravitational force.

\noindent
The gravitational force's $y$-component is $-mg$, again agreeing with what we knew. These two components give the gravitational force vector shown in \in{figure}[fig:cannonForce].
While potential energy itself does not have a direction, Lagrange's procedure produces the force vector, which does have a direction.

Keeping track of the different virtual changes $\partial U$ due to the different virtual displacements $\partial x$ and $\partial y$ can get confusing, but Lagrange has good news. The ratios $\partial U\!/\partial x$ and $\partial U\!/\partial y$ can be easily found using the same derivative rules that we learned for rates of change (like $v = dx/dt$). When computing $\partial U\!/\partial x$ we keep $y$ constant. When computing $\partial U\!/\partial y$ we keep $x$ constant.

\startexample[ex:CannonDirivaties]
Use Lagrange's equation and the derivative rules to find the force components $F_x$ and $F_y$ on the cannon ball.
\startsolution
The $x$ component of the force is given by Lagrange's equation with a virtual displacement in the $x$-direction.
\startformula
	F_x = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} = -\ppx U = -\ppx mgy = 0
\stopformula
When calculating $\partial U\!/\partial x$ we keep $y$ constant, which makes $mgy$ constant. The derivative of a constant is zero.

The $y$ component of the force is given by Lagrange's equation with a virtual displacement in the $y$-direction.
\startformula
	F_y = = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial y} = -\ppy U = -\ppy mgy =  -mg\ppy y = -mg
\stopformula
After pulling the coefficient $mg$ out of the derivative, we compute $\ppy y$ using the power rule with $n=1$.
\stopsolution
\stopexample

The ratios $\partial U\!/\partial x$ and $\partial U\!/\partial y$ are called partial derivatives of $U$ because we compute them allowing only one part of our coordinates (either $x$ or $y$) to change while other parts are kept constant. Computing partial derivatives is much easier than dealing with many tiny virtual displacements. As a result, Lagrange replaced many diagrams with partial derivatives.

\section{Hamilton's canonical equations of motion}

We will study Hamilton's general method in this chapter. First, we will learn to produce equations of motion from a system's total energy formula. Then, we will learn some methods of solving these equations of motion in specific examples. In \in{Chapter}[ch:Rotation], Hamilton's general method will explain the compound motions of planets. In \in{Chapter}[ch:Waves], it will reveal the compound vibrations of a musical string.

Hamilton's general method brings together the big ideas of position, momentum, and energy in a surprisingly simple way. Hamilton found that he did not need two separate formulas for kinetic energy and potential energy, one formula for the total energy is enough. (He chose the symbol $H$ for total energy, which we have adopted.) Hamilton also recognized momentum's importance, and used momentum in his formula for total energy. For example, to describe the cart-on-a-spring system in \in{figure}[fig:HamiltonSpringCart], Hamilton would write the total energy

\startformula
  H = \textfrac{1}{2m}p^2 + \textfrac{k}{2}x^2. %\frac{p^2}{2m} + \half kx^2
\stopformula
The coefficients $1/2m$ and $k/2$ are constants. The dynamical variables $p$ and $x$ describe the system's changing momentum and position.
Euler and Lagrange used velocity rather than momentum, writing kinetic energy as $K=\onehalf mv^2$. Using velocity is reasonable, but it caused the update formulas to get tangled. Hamilton discovered that using momentum allowed him to separate the update formulas, making the equations of motion much easier to understand and solve. When a system's total energy is written in Hamilton's form, with positions and momenta, it is called the system's \keyterm{Hamiltonian}.

%\section{Hamilton's momentum update formula}

%Hamilton's momentum update formula uses and idea similar to Lagrange's equation, 

Hamilton followed Daniel Bernoulli's advice and described all interactions as potential energy, not Newtonian forces. There is a bit of an obstacle to this approach. Lagrange's equation tells us how to convert to Newton's force from potential energy, but it does not tell us how to convert the other way. In fact, some forces (like friction) cannot be described using potential energy and must be left as outside forces acting on the system. We will use $F$ only for these external forces. Any interaction that can be described using potential energy will be included in the energy formula.

The system's total energy $H$ and the external force $F$ come together in Hamilton's momentum update formula.
\startformula[eq:Hamilton2]
	dp = \left(-\ppx H + F \right) dt
\stopformula
Parts of this new formula should be reassuringly familiar. For a system with only external forces (no energy) this is Newton's momentum update formula, $dp = F\,dt$. The new term on the right looks almost identical to Lagrange's equation, $F\sub{Newton} = -\partial U/\partial x$, but Hamilton replaces the potential energy $U$ with the total energy $H$. This replacement will be essential when using curved coordinates, like the polar coordinate used to describe orbits.%, but it has no effect in most of the systems we have studied.

To see Hamilton's procedure in action, let us find the momentum update formula for the familiar cart-on-a-spring system. First, put the system's Hamiltonian into Hamilton's momentum update formula. The spring is included in the system, so there are no external forces.
\startformula
	dp = \left( -\ppx H + \cancel{F} \right) dt
		%= -\ppx H dt
		= -\ppx \left( \textfrac{1}{2m}p^2 + \textfrac{k}{2}x^2 \right) dt
\stopformula
Use the sum rule and then the coefficient rule to pull the coefficients out of the partial derivatives.
\startformula\startmathalignment
\NC	dp	\NC = -\left( \ppx  \textfrac{1}{2m}p^2 + \ppx\textfrac{k}{2}x^2 \right) dt		\NR
\NC		\NC = -\left( \textfrac{1}{2m} \ppx p^2 + \textfrac{k}{2} \ppx x^2 \right) dt	\NR
\stopmathalignment\stopformula
When calculating the partial derivative $\partial/\partial x$, the variable $p$ is constant. Therefore, the constant rule for derivatives tells us that the first term in parenthesis is zero. The second term is found using the power rule with $n=2$.
\startformula
	dp = -\left( 0 + \textfrac{k}{2} 2x^{(2-1)} \right) dt
		= - kx\,dt
\stopformula
This is the correct position update formula that we found before using Hooke's law. 

Hamilton found that the total energy $H$ also produces the position update formula. 
\startformula
	dx = \pp{p} H\,dt
\stopformula
This formula is not familiar, but with your new derivative skills it will be easy to use.
\startexample[ex:CannonDirivaties]
Use Hamilton's position update formula to find the position update formula for the cart-on-a-spring system in \in{figure}[fig:HamiltonSpringCart].
\startsolution

\stopformula
When calculating the partial derivative $\partial/\partial p$, the variable $x$ is constant. Therefore, the constant rule for derivatives tells us that the second term in parenthesis is zero. The first term is found using the power rule with $n=2$.

Hamilton's general method produces the complete equations of motion for any mechanical system from the system's Hamiltonian – the system's total energy written in terms of the positions and momenta. Hamilton's method is a favorite with physicists because of its power, beauty, and practicality. The method is also excellent for students. Writing the Hamiltonian is often fairly easy, even for complicated systems; the method often requires only basic skills with derivatives; and the equations of motion are separated into their most useful form. Hamilton's method is not necessary for a simple system like the cart on a spring, but it is ideal for our quadrivium problems.
